However, we have outsourced the code for the evaluation, Langchain LLM model creation and vectorstore interaction to script files which can be found in the `src` directory. We will reference these scripts in the respective sections and explain the code in place.\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to compare the performance of different pipelines we need to evaluate them. The evaluation is done with the `ragas` library and classical non-LLM based metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "`ragas` provides predefined metrics for the evaluation which are described in the [documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Further an overview of the metrics used in the evaluation is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc7_1_'></a>[RAGAS Metrics](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ragas` metrics are LLM-based evaluated metrics where the LLM is used to rate the generated answers and retrieved contexts against labeled ground truths. As LLM are known for their non-deterministic behavior, the metrics should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, they provide a relatively simple and straightforward way to evaluate the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Answer Correctness**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_correctness.html): This metric assesses the accuracy of the generated answer compared to the ground truth. It combines semantic and factual similarities between the answer and ground truth, providing a score ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates that the generated answer closely aligns with the ground truth, reflecting a more correct response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**Context Precision**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_precision.html): This metric evaluates the relevance of the contexts retrieved by the RAG system in relation to the ground truth. It checks if the relevant items from the ground truth are ranked higher in the retrieved contexts. Scores range from 0 to 1, where higher values suggest better precision and relevance of the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [**Answer Relevancy**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_relevance.html): Focused on the pertinence of the generated answer to the question, this metric scores based on how complete and free from redundant information the answer is. Higher scores indicate more relevant answers. It uses the mean cosine similarity between the original question and artificial questions generated based on the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [**Answer Semantic Similarity**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/semantic_similarity.html): This metric evaluates the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. It uses a cross-encoder model to calculate semantic similarity, with scores between 0 and 1. Higher scores signify a better semantic alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [**Context Entity Recall**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_entities_recall.html): This metric measures the recall of entities in the retrieved contexts against those in the ground truths. It is particularly useful in scenarios where factual accuracy and entity coverage are crucial, such as in historical QA or tourism help desks. The score is calculated by comparing the number of entities that overlap between the ground truths and contexts with the total number of entities in the ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## <a id='toc7_2_'></a>[Non-LLM Based Metrics](#toc0_)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the RAGAS metrics, we will also use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the pipelines. They provide further specific insights into the retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reciprocal Rank**: The reciprocal rank is a metric that evaluates the ranking of the correct answer in the list of retrieved answers. It is calculated as the reciprocal of the rank of the correct answer. A higher reciprocal rank indicates that the correct answer is ranked higher in the list of retrieved answers.\n",
    "2. **Hit@K**: The Hit@K metric evaluates whether the correct answer is present in the top K retrieved answers. It is calculated as a binary value, where 1 indicates that the correct answer is present in the top K retrieved answers, and 0 indicates otherwise. A higher Hit@K value indicates that the correct answer is more likely to be found in the top K retrieved answers\n",

    "The impact of chunking on the retrieval and generation performance is a crucial aspect of the RAG pipeline. The chunking strategy determines how the text is divided into smaller sections for processing and embedding. The choice of chunking strategy can significantly influence the granularity, relevance, and efficiency of the RAG system. Too big chunks might lead to irrelevant information being included in the retrieval and generation process, while too small chunks might result in fragmented information and loss of context.\n",

    "Given the baseline pipeline, which uses the recursive character chunking strategy with a chunk size of 1000 characters, we will now change this strategy to use smaller chunks of 200 characters each. The goal is to evaluate the impact of the chunking strategy on the retrieval and generation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using smaller chunks we expect the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Increased granularity**: Smaller chunks allow for more precise retrieval and better matching of the query.\n",
    "- **Improved Relevance of Retrieved Content**: With smaller chunks, the system can more accurately match the query with specific parts of the documents that are most relevant. This could enhance the relevance of the content fed into the generation module of the RAG system, leading to more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n",

Following this, the document is used to retrieve relevant documents from the vector store, which are then passed to the LLM model for answer generation.\n",
