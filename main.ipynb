    "# Structure of our Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook serves as the main entry point for our solution to the NPR Mini-Challenge 1. We will provide a detailed explanation of our approach and the code we used to solve the task. However, we have outsourced the code for the evaluation, Langchain LLM model creation and vectorstore interaction to script files which can be found in the `src` directory. We will reference these scripts in the respective sections and explain the code in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, scripts for the development subset and subset evaluation set creation can be found in the `scripts` directory and will be referenced in their respective sections. These were primarily used to speed up the development process and are not necessary for the final solution as we will use the full dataset for the latest evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook starts by setting up a baseline pipeline. After that, we will conduct a series of experiments to explore the impact of different strategies on the performance of the pipeline. The experiments are designed to test the effectiveness of different retrieval and generation strategies in the RAG pipeline.\n",

    "# Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup section is used to import the necessary libraries and set the configuration for the notebook. We will also load the environment variables from the `.env` file to set the configuration for the notebook. The configuration includes the paths to the data files and the configuration for the Phoenix library.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an option of three boolean variables which can be set to `True` or `False` to configure the notebook:\n",
    "- `DEV_MODE`: If set to `True`, the notebook will use the development subset of the data. If set to `False`, the notebook will use the full dataset.\n",
    "- `USE_GPU`: If set to `True`, the notebook will use the GPU for the computations. If set to `False`, the notebook will use the CPU.\n",
    "- `USE_CACHE`: If set to `True`, the notebook will use the cache for the computations. If set to `False`, the notebook will not use the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "The caching is especially useful when running the notebook multiple times to avoid recomputing the same results. Especially the evaluation of the pipelines can be time-consuming and require a lot of tokens from the Azure API. Therefore, it is recommended to set `USE_CACHE` to `True` when running the notebook multiple times."

    "4. **Duplicate Removal:** Identify and remove duplicate text chunks based on content to ensure uniqueness in the dataset.\n",
    "5. **Content Concatenation:** If the text content is split across multiple entries or rows, concatenate these into a single text chunk per dataset entry.\n",
    "6. **Adding Unique Identifiers:** Generate and append a unique identifier to each row based on the content's hash value, which helps in tracking and indexing the data for the evaluation process of the retrieval."

    "Another important step in the indexing process is to split the documents into smaller chunks. This division is crucial for managing large documents, improving the granularity of search results, and enhancing the efficiency of the embedding process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose and Benefits**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Manageability**: Smaller chunks are easier to process and store, reducing the computational burden on the system.\n",
    "- **Precision**: By embedding smaller sections of text, the system can achieve more precise document retrieval, particularly for queries that target specific information within a large document.\n",
    "- **Performance**: Smaller text chunks lead to faster processing times during both embedding and retrieval phases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the baseline pipeline, we will use the Recursive Character Text Splitter from the Langchain library. This splitter divides the text into smaller chunks based on the character count, ensuring that each chunk is of a manageable size for processing and embedding. The following parameters are used for the splitter:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Chunk Size**: The maximum number of characters in each chunk.\n",
    "    - We use a chunk size of 1000 characters to ensure that the chunks are small enough for efficient processing but large enough to capture meaningful information. \n",
    "- **Chunk Overlap**: The number of characters that overlap between adjacent chunks.\n",
    "    - We set the overlap to 0 to avoid redundancy and ensure that each chunk contains unique information.   \n",
    "- **Length Function**: The function used to calculate the length of the text.\n",
    "- **Is Separator Regex**: A flag indicating whether the separator is a regular expression.\n",

    "# Evaluation Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare the performance of different pipelines we need to evaluate them. The evaluation is done with the `ragas` library and classical non-LLM based metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "`ragas` provides predefined metrics for the evaluation which are described in the [documentation](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/index.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "Further an overview of the metrics used in the evaluation is provided below:\n",
    "\n",
    "## RAGAS Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ragas` metrics are LLM-based evaluated metrics where the LLM is used to rate the generated answers and retrieved contexts against labeled ground truths. As LLM are known for their non-deterministic behavior, the metrics should be taken with a grain of salt. Nevertheless, they provide a relatively simple and straightforward way to evaluate the performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [**Answer Correctness**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_correctness.html): This metric assesses the accuracy of the generated answer compared to the ground truth. It combines semantic and factual similarities between the answer and ground truth, providing a score ranging from 0 to 1. A higher score indicates that the generated answer closely aligns with the ground truth, reflecting a more correct response.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. [**Context Precision**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_precision.html): This metric evaluates the relevance of the contexts retrieved by the RAG system in relation to the ground truth. It checks if the relevant items from the ground truth are ranked higher in the retrieved contexts. Scores range from 0 to 1, where higher values suggest better precision and relevance of the retrieved information.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. [**Answer Relevancy**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/answer_relevance.html): Focused on the pertinence of the generated answer to the question, this metric scores based on how complete and free from redundant information the answer is. Higher scores indicate more relevant answers. It uses the mean cosine similarity between the original question and artificial questions generated based on the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. [**Answer Semantic Similarity**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/semantic_similarity.html): This metric evaluates the semantic resemblance between the generated answer and the ground truth. It uses a cross-encoder model to calculate semantic similarity, with scores between 0 and 1. Higher scores signify a better semantic alignment between the generated answer and the ground truth.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. [**Context Entity Recall**](https://docs.ragas.io/en/stable/concepts/metrics/context_entities_recall.html): This metric measures the recall of entities in the retrieved contexts against those in the ground truths. It is particularly useful in scenarios where factual accuracy and entity coverage are crucial, such as in historical QA or tourism help desks. The score is calculated by comparing the number of entities that overlap between the ground truths and contexts with the total number of entities in the ground truths.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-LLM Based Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the RAGAS metrics, we will also use the following metrics to evaluate the performance of the pipelines. They provide further specific insights into the retrieval performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reciprocal Rank**: The reciprocal rank is a metric that evaluates the ranking of the correct answer in the list of retrieved answers. It is calculated as the reciprocal of the rank of the correct answer. A higher reciprocal rank indicates that the correct answer is ranked higher in the list of retrieved answers.\n",
    "2. **Hit@K**: The Hit@K metric evaluates whether the correct answer is present in the top K retrieved answers. It is calculated as a binary value, where 1 indicates that the correct answer is present in the top K retrieved answers, and 0 indicates otherwise. A higher Hit@K value indicates that the correct answer is more likely to be found in the top K retrieved answers."

(2022) in the paper [\"Precise Zero-Shot Dense Retrieval without Relevance Label\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496), the HyDE pipeline leverages the innovative concept of Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE).\n",

This document is designed to capture the essential relevance patterns from the input question potentially containing inaccuracies or hypothetical details. Following this, the document is used to retrieve relevant documents from the vector store, which are then passed to the LLM model for answer generation.\n",
