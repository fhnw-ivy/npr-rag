       " (Document(page_content='Global energy companies are shifting to ESG investing but what are the drivers to decarbonise and the innovative approaches being deployed In this new series Mike Scott takes the temperature of the industry s response to date as well as the challenges ahead that this shift will present The energy sector faces a turbulent transitional autumn framed by the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC and the crucial COP26 Glasgow Scotland meeting in November We re seeing a growing number of companies divesting their highcarbon assets as BHP has just done in selling its oil and gas unit to Australian compatriot Woodside However investors and campaigners are starting to point out that while this helps the seller to decarbonise it makes no difference to total carbon emissions  indeed if you sell to someone less concerned about climate change you may end up increasing carbon emissions The coal mining sector should give energy companies pause for thought New research from E3G and Global Energy Monitor shows that the pipeline of planned coal mining plants has dropped by 76 since the 2015 signing of the Paris Agreement with 84 countries either having explicitly banned new coal power or having no plans to build new coal plants And a new sustainable investing initiative may point to the future for the assets that remain  a group of investors backed by the Asian Development Bank are planning to work with governments to buy up coal plants and shut them down within 15 years much earlier than planned but enough time to allow workers to retrain and find new jobs and to allow countries to switch to renewable energy You can be sure that if it works for coal then it will start to be applied to oil and gas as well Investors are becoming increasingly vocal and insistent about what they expect from the sector A new Net Zero emissions Standard for Oil and Gas  sets minimum expectation for what must be included in net zero transition plans from oil and gas companies to create a level playing field in corporate reporting and meet investor expectations for credible and comparable company net zero transition plans  the group says The standard emerged from discussions between leading investors and major oil and gas companies and will now be piloted by companies including BP Eni Repsol Shell and Total It calls for comprehensive absolute and intensity emissions reduction targets and alignment of capital expenditure and production plans with a net zero emissions target It acknowledges that  windingdown is a legitimate strategy as well as diversifying energy offerings or working through a company s value chain to reshape demand The Standard joins the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Net Zero Insurance Alliance as part of a growing push by investors to target the highest emitting greenhouse gas industries and companies Aided by growing amounts of highquality data this increasingly focused investor pressure is leaving energy companies little choice but to react That was evident during a stunning 2021 results season where sustainable finance ESG investing and ESG investors won shareholder resolutions demanding climate action from companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron And the results of these votes are starting to feed through although there is a tangible sense that companies are struggling to work out how to be socially responsible as well as how to satisfy both climate change campaigners and the investors who want to continue enjoying the sector s hefty dividends Chevron has just announced plans to spend  10bn in the next seven years on cutting emissions and renewable energy It is still less than a tenth of its planned capital expenditure but such a commitment would have been unthinkable even a year ago Yet its CEO added that the company would rather pay out dividends to shareholders  so they can plant trees  than build more renewable energy capacity Such defensive statements have often been followed by more ambitious plans a few months later Meanwhile the court case that forced Royal Dutch Shell to cut its emissions by 45 by 2030 has been followed by ABP one of the Netherlands biggest pension funds being sued in an attempt to make it sell its fossil fuel shares Shell initially said that it would comply with the ruling but is now appealing  We agree urgent action is needed and we will accelerate our transition to net zero  said CEO Ben van Beurden  But we will appeal because a court judgment against a single company is not effective  Nonetheless the sector can expect more climate change litigation in the months ahead As always mergers and acquisitions deal activity slowed to a trickle over the summer but according to Pricewaterhousecoopers  PwC  global decarbonisation coupled with plentiful capital and an economy emerging from the pandemic will continue to drive strong M  A activity through the rest of 2021 What is now a global transformation to net zero emissions will continue to influence M  A activity and capital project investment decisions  There certainly seems to be no shortage of capital available for green investing and clean energy projects Bloomberg New Energy Finance  BNEF reported that clean energy projects and companies attracted  174bn in investments in the first half of 2021 the highest first half total ever The second six months of the year normally produces more deals The emergence of special purpose acquisition companies  SPACs is driving up deal multiples for  technologycentric energytransition assets  PwC adds  Carbonintensive projects and companies with large ESG risks on the other hand are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain financeas well as insurance  Energy Vault a  gravitybased energy storage company combined with a SPAC in a deal that values it at  16bn for example while Britishvolt the company building the UK s first battery  gigafactory has been valued at more than  1bn after its latest funding round highlighting the growing demand for green energy and energy transition investments Meanwhile the energy majors tentative but ever more ambitious steps into the clean energy world continue  Shell New Energies has bought Inspire Energy a US renewable energy residential retailer while its Ubitricity EV charging subsidiary announced plans to install 50000 charge points in the UK by 2025 effectively doubling the country s charging capacity Many in the clean energy community welcomed BP s appointment of AnjaIsabel Dotzenrath formerly head of RWE Renewables to lead its lowcarbon business as indicating its commitment to cleaner energy Adam Vaughan chief reporter at New Scientist said that the appointment sends  a clear message on  BP s  direction of travel away from oil and gas  One sector that has seen stratospheric growth  and that the energy sector is increasingly pinning its hopes on  is hydrogen which can help lower carbon emissions hardtoabate industries such as cement glassmaking and steel In recent months the world s first glass and steel made using hydrogen have been produced at Pilkington in the UK and Sweden s SSAB respectively  Nearly everything has doubled already this year in the world of clean hydrogen and we expect the momentum to continue in the months ahead  said Martin Tengler lead hydrogen analyst at BNEF As the UK government published its hydrogen strategy including plans to blend hydrogen into the wider gas network BNEF reported that some 16GW of electrolyser capacity  crucial for making green hydrogen  could come online by 2024 In 2020 global electrolyser capacity was just 200MW However there is no consensus on what the future hydrogen economy should look like Tony Ballance of gas network Cadent called for a mandate for  hydrogenready boilers from 2025 while Jess Ralston analyst at Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit  ECIU said  Hydrogen could be very valuable for cleaning up steel production But questions remain over whether the government has truly grasped which areas will be most suitable for hydrogen use and which will not', metadata={'author': '',

gas traders in the world said Thursday consumption held steady in 2020 despite Covid19 and is on course to expand as economies recover However a dearth in sanctioned projects is forecast to create a supply gap According to Shell s annual global liquefied natural gas  LNG trade report consumption increased to 360 million metric tons  mmt in 2020 versus 358 mmt in 2019 Gains last year were driven by Asian consumption even as the pandemic locked down economies and sucked the air out of gross domestic product  GDP  Though marginal the increase in volume reflects the resilience and flexibility of the global LNG market in 2020 a year which saw losses to global GDP of several trillion dollars as economies large and small struggled to contain the Covid19 outbreak  researchers noted Global gas prices hit a record low early last year but they ended 2020 at a sixyear high as Asian demand recovered and winter buying increased against tightened supply  LNG provided flexible energy which the world needed during the Covid19 pandemic demonstrating its resilience and ability to power people s lives in these unprecedented times  said Shell s Maarten Wetselaar director of Integrated Gas Renewables and Energy Solutions  Around the world countries and companies including Shell are adopting netzero emissions targets and seeking to create lowercarbon energy systems As the cleanestburning fossil fuel natural gas and LNG have a central role to play in delivering the energy the world needs and helping power progress towards these targets  Shell definitely has some skin in the game Earlier this month the AngloDutch supermajor announced its most ambitious makeover in its centuryold history It is throttling back oil production as it inches toward a lowcarbon future but for natural gas the global opportunities abound The percentage of total gas in Shell s portfolio  is expected to rise to around 55 or more  by the end of the decade CEO Ben van Beurden told investors at the time As global gas consumption expands Shell also may be eyeing a plethora of opportunities The latest LNG analysis is forecasting a supplydemand gap opening around 2025 with less production coming onstream than previously projected Shell estimated that only 3 mmt in new LNG production capacity was announced in 2020 down from an expected 60 mmt researchers noted This year it is looking stronger For example Shell s frequent partner and No 1 gas producer Qatar Petroleum this month said it was sanctioning its largest LNG expansion ever at the massive North Field US projects also may move forward For example Houstonbased NextDecade Corp has said it plans to reach a final investment decision this year on  a minimum of two trains  at the proposed export terminal in South Texas Wood Mackenzie also has estimated that  11 billion of Australian gas projects could be sanctioned this year CarbonNeutral Gains Last year gas demand rebounded in Asia China and India following the outbreak of the pandemic Shell data showed China increased its LNG imports in 2020 by an estimated 11 from 2019 or 7 mmt to 67 mmt  China s announcement of a target to become carbonneutral by 2060 is expected to continue driving up its LNG demand  researchers noted LNG is forecast to play a  key role  in decarbonizing China s  hardtoabate sectors namely buildings heavy industry shipping and heavyduty road transport  Meanwhile India increased LNG imports by 11 yearyear in 2020 as it took advantage of lower prices to supplement domestic gas production  Two other major Asian LNGimporting countries  Japan and South Korea  also announced netzero emissions targets in 2020  researchers noted Those targets should lead to more gas consumption For example to meet its netzero target South Korea plans to switch 24 coalfired power plants to LNG by 2034 researchers said Meanwhile European demand alongside  flexible US supply helped to balance the global LNG market in the first half of 2020  according to Shell  However supply outages in other basins structural constraints and extreme weather later in the year resulted in higher prices  By 2040 global LNG demand is estimated to hit 700 mmt driven by a 75 surge in Asian growth  For instance China s heavyduty transport sector consumed nearly 13 mmt of LNG in 2020 almost doubling from 2018 to serve the fastgrowing fleet of well over 500000 LNGfueled trucks and buses  researchers said  LNGfueled shipping is also growing with the number of vessels expected to more than double with bunkering vessels set to reach 45 by 2023  Shell is looking to find an advantage in that sector The producer already has chartered four newbuild lowemission tankers that are scheduled for delivery beginning in mid2024  According to estimates more than half of future

series Mike Scott takes the temperature of the industry s response to date as well as the challenges ahead that this shift will present The energy sector faces a turbulent transitional autumn framed by the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC and the crucial COP26 Glasgow Scotland meeting in November We re seeing a growing number of companies divesting their highcarbon assets as BHP has just done in selling its oil and gas unit to Australian compatriot Woodside However investors and campaigners are starting to point out that while this helps the seller to decarbonise it makes no difference to total carbon emissions  indeed if you sell to someone less concerned about climate change you may end up increasing carbon emissions The coal mining sector should give energy companies pause for thought New research from E3G and Global Energy Monitor shows that the pipeline of planned coal mining plants has dropped by 76 since the 2015 signing of the Paris Agreement with 84 countries either having explicitly banned new coal power or having no plans to build new coal plants And a new sustainable investing initiative may point to the future for the assets that remain  a group of investors backed by the Asian Development Bank are planning to work with governments to buy up coal plants and shut them down within 15 years much earlier than planned but enough time to allow workers to retrain and find new jobs and to allow countries to switch to renewable energy You can be sure that if it works for coal then it will start to be applied to oil and gas as well Investors are becoming increasingly vocal and insistent about what they expect from the sector A new Net Zero emissions Standard for Oil and Gas  sets minimum expectation for what must be included in net zero transition plans from oil and gas companies to create a level playing field in corporate reporting and meet investor expectations for credible and comparable company net zero transition plans  the group says The standard emerged from discussions between leading investors and major oil and gas companies and will now be piloted by companies including BP Eni Repsol Shell and Total It calls for comprehensive absolute and intensity emissions reduction targets and alignment of capital expenditure and production plans with a net zero emissions target It acknowledges that  windingdown is a legitimate strategy as well as diversifying energy offerings or working through a company s value chain to reshape demand The Standard joins the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Net Zero Insurance Alliance as part of a growing push by investors to target the highest emitting greenhouse gas industries and companies Aided by growing amounts of highquality data this increasingly focused investor pressure is leaving energy companies little choice but to react That was evident during a stunning 2021 results season where sustainable finance ESG investing and ESG investors won shareholder resolutions demanding climate action from companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron And the results of these votes are starting to feed through although there is a tangible sense that companies are struggling to work out how to be socially responsible as well as how to satisfy both climate change campaigners and the investors who want to continue enjoying the sector s hefty dividends Chevron has just announced plans to spend  10bn in the next seven years on cutting emissions and renewable energy It is still less than a tenth of its planned capital expenditure but such a commitment would have been unthinkable even a year ago Yet its CEO added that the company would rather pay out dividends to shareholders  so they can plant trees  than build more renewable energy capacity Such defensive statements have often been followed by more ambitious plans a few months later Meanwhile the court case that forced Royal Dutch Shell to cut its emissions by 45 by 2030 has been followed by ABP one of the Netherlands biggest pension funds being sued in an attempt to make it sell its fossil fuel shares Shell initially said that it would comply with the ruling but is now appealing  We agree urgent action is needed and we will accelerate our transition to net zero  said CEO Ben van Beurden  But we will appeal because a court judgment against a single company is not effective  Nonetheless the sector can expect more climate change litigation in the months ahead As always mergers and acquisitions deal activity slowed to a trickle over the summer but according to Pricewaterhousecoopers  PwC  global decarbonisation coupled with plentiful capital and an economy emerging from the pandemic will continue to drive strong M  A activity through the rest of 2021 What is now a global transformation to net zero emissions will continue to influence M  A activity and capital project investment decisions  There certainly seems to be no shortage of capital available for green investing and clean energy projects Bloomberg New Energy Finance  BNEF reported that clean energy projects and companies attracted  174bn in investments in the first half of 2021 the highest first half total ever The second six months of the year normally produces more deals The emergence of special purpose acquisition companies  SPACs is driving up deal multiples for  technologycentric energytransition assets  PwC adds  Carbonintensive projects and companies with large ESG risks on the other hand are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain financeas well as insurance  Energy Vault a  gravitybased energy storage company combined with a SPAC in a deal that values it at  16bn for example while Britishvolt the company building the UK s first battery  gigafactory has been valued at more than  1bn after its latest funding round highlighting the growing demand for green energy and energy transition investments Meanwhile the energy majors tentative but ever more ambitious steps into the clean energy world continue  Shell New Energies has bought Inspire Energy a US renewable energy residential retailer while its Ubitricity EV charging subsidiary announced plans to install 50000 charge points in the UK by 2025 effectively doubling the country s charging capacity Many in the clean energy community welcomed BP s appointment of AnjaIsabel Dotzenrath formerly head of RWE Renewables to lead its lowcarbon business as indicating its commitment to cleaner energy Adam Vaughan chief reporter at New Scientist said that the appointment sends  a clear message on  BP s  direction of travel away from oil and gas  One sector that has seen stratospheric growth  and that the energy sector is increasingly pinning its hopes on  is hydrogen which can help lower carbon emissions hardtoabate industries such as cement glassmaking and steel In recent months the world s first glass and steel made using hydrogen have been produced at Pilkington in the UK and Sweden s SSAB respectively  Nearly everything has doubled already this year in the world of clean hydrogen and we expect the momentum to continue in the months ahead  said Martin Tengler lead hydrogen analyst at BNEF As the UK government published its hydrogen strategy including plans to blend hydrogen into the wider gas network BNEF reported that some 16GW of electrolyser capacity  crucial for making green hydrogen  could come online by 2024 In 2020 global electrolyser capacity was just 200MW However there is no consensus on what the future hydrogen economy should look like Tony Ballance of gas network Cadent called for a mandate for  hydrogenready boilers from 2025 while Jess Ralston analyst at Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit  ECIU said  Hydrogen could be very valuable for cleaning up steel production But questions remain over whether the government has truly grasped which areas will be most suitable for hydrogen use and which will

       "{'context': [Document(page_content='Global energy companies are shifting to ESG investing but what are the drivers to decarbonise and the innovative approaches being deployed In this new series Mike Scott takes the temperature of the industry s response to date as well as the challenges ahead that this shift will present The energy sector faces a turbulent transitional autumn framed by the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  IPCC and the crucial COP26 Glasgow Scotland meeting in November We re seeing a growing number of companies divesting their highcarbon assets as BHP has just done in selling its oil and gas unit to Australian compatriot Woodside However investors and campaigners are starting to point out that while this helps the seller to decarbonise it makes no difference to total carbon emissions  indeed if you sell to someone less concerned about climate change you may end up increasing carbon emissions The coal mining sector should give energy companies pause for thought New research from E3G and Global Energy Monitor shows that the pipeline of planned coal mining plants has dropped by 76 since the 2015 signing of the Paris Agreement with 84 countries either having explicitly banned new coal power or having no plans to build new coal plants And a new sustainable investing initiative may point to the future for the assets that remain  a group of investors backed by the Asian Development Bank are planning to work with governments to buy up coal plants and shut them down within 15 years much earlier than planned but enough time to allow workers to retrain and find new jobs and to allow countries to switch to renewable energy You can be sure that if it works for coal then it will start to be applied to oil and gas as well Investors are becoming increasingly vocal and insistent about what they expect from the sector A new Net Zero emissions Standard for Oil and Gas  sets minimum expectation for what must be included in net zero transition plans from oil and gas companies to create a level playing field in corporate reporting and meet investor expectations for credible and comparable company net zero transition plans  the group says The standard emerged from discussions between leading investors and major oil and gas companies and will now be piloted by companies including BP Eni Repsol Shell and Total It calls for comprehensive absolute and intensity emissions reduction targets and alignment of capital expenditure and production plans with a net zero emissions target It acknowledges that  windingdown is a legitimate strategy as well as diversifying energy offerings or working through a company s value chain to reshape demand The Standard joins the Net Zero Asset Owners Alliance the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative and the Net Zero Insurance Alliance as part of a growing push by investors to target the highest emitting greenhouse gas industries and companies Aided by growing amounts of highquality data this increasingly focused investor pressure is leaving energy companies little choice but to react That was evident during a stunning 2021 results season where sustainable finance ESG investing and ESG investors won shareholder resolutions demanding climate action from companies such as ExxonMobil and Chevron And the results of these votes are starting to feed through although there is a tangible sense that companies are struggling to work out how to be socially responsible as well as how to satisfy both climate change campaigners and the investors who want to continue enjoying the sector s hefty dividends Chevron has just announced plans to spend  10bn in the next seven years on cutting emissions and renewable energy It is still less than a tenth of its planned capital expenditure but such a commitment would have been unthinkable even a year ago Yet its CEO added that the company would rather pay out dividends to shareholders  so they can plant trees  than build more renewable energy capacity Such defensive statements have often been followed by more ambitious plans a few months later Meanwhile the court case that forced Royal Dutch Shell to cut its emissions by 45 by 2030 has been followed by ABP one of the Netherlands biggest pension funds being sued in an attempt to make it sell its fossil fuel shares Shell initially said that it would comply with the ruling but is now appealing  We agree urgent action is needed and we will accelerate our transition to net zero  said CEO Ben van Beurden  But we will appeal because a court judgment against a single company is not effective  Nonetheless the sector can expect more climate change litigation in the months ahead As always mergers and acquisitions deal activity slowed to a trickle over the summer but according to Pricewaterhousecoopers  PwC  global decarbonisation coupled with plentiful capital and an economy emerging from the pandemic will continue to drive strong M  A activity through the rest of 2021 What is now a global transformation to net zero emissions will continue to influence M  A activity and capital project investment decisions  There certainly seems to be no shortage of capital available for green investing and clean energy projects Bloomberg New Energy Finance  BNEF reported that clean energy projects and companies attracted  174bn in investments in the first half of 2021 the highest first half total ever The second six months of the year normally produces more deals The emergence of special purpose acquisition companies  SPACs is driving up deal multiples for  technologycentric energytransition assets  PwC adds  Carbonintensive projects and companies with large ESG risks on the other hand are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain financeas well as insurance  Energy Vault a  gravitybased energy storage company combined with a SPAC in a deal that values it at  16bn for example while Britishvolt the company building the UK s first battery  gigafactory has been valued at more than  1bn after its latest funding round highlighting the growing demand for green energy and energy transition investments Meanwhile the energy majors tentative but ever more ambitious steps into the clean energy world continue  Shell New Energies has bought Inspire Energy a US renewable energy residential retailer while its Ubitricity EV charging subsidiary announced plans to install 50000 charge points in the UK by 2025 effectively doubling the country s charging capacity Many in the clean energy community welcomed BP s appointment of AnjaIsabel Dotzenrath formerly head of RWE Renewables to lead its lowcarbon business as indicating its commitment to cleaner energy Adam Vaughan chief reporter at New Scientist said that the appointment sends  a clear message on  BP s  direction of travel away from oil and gas  One sector that has seen stratospheric growth  and that the energy sector is increasingly pinning its hopes on  is hydrogen which can help lower carbon emissions hardtoabate industries such as cement glassmaking and steel In recent months the world s first glass and steel made using hydrogen have been produced at Pilkington in the UK and Sweden s SSAB respectively  Nearly everything has doubled already this year in the world of clean hydrogen and we expect the momentum to continue in the months ahead  said Martin Tengler lead hydrogen analyst at BNEF As the UK government published its hydrogen strategy including plans to blend hydrogen into the wider gas network BNEF reported that some 16GW of electrolyser capacity  crucial for making green hydrogen  could come online by 2024 In 2020 global electrolyser capacity was just 200MW However there is no consensus on what the future hydrogen economy should look like Tony Ballance of gas network Cadent called for a mandate for  hydrogenready boilers from 2025 while Jess Ralston analyst at Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit  ECIU said  Hydrogen could be very valuable for cleaning up steel production But questions remain over whether the government has truly grasped which areas will be most suitable for hydrogen use and which will

       "  Document(page_content='LNG Insight LNG  Daily GPI  Infrastructure  Natural Gas Prices  NGI All News Access  NGI The Weekly Gas Market Report Royal Dutch Shell plc one of the leading natural gas traders in the world said Thursday consumption held steady in 2020 despite Covid19 and is on course to expand as economies recover However a dearth in sanctioned projects is forecast to create a supply gap According to Shell s annual global liquefied natural gas  LNG trade report consumption increased to 360 million metric tons  mmt in 2020 versus 358 mmt in 2019 Gains last year were driven by Asian consumption even as the pandemic locked down economies and sucked the air out of gross domestic product  GDP  Though marginal the increase in volume reflects the resilience and flexibility of the global LNG market in 2020 a year which saw losses to global GDP of several trillion dollars as economies large and small struggled to contain the Covid19 outbreak  researchers noted Global gas prices hit a record low early last year but they ended 2020 at a sixyear high as Asian demand recovered and winter buying increased against tightened supply  LNG provided flexible energy which the world needed during the Covid19 pandemic demonstrating its resilience and ability to power people s lives in these unprecedented times  said Shell s Maarten Wetselaar director of Integrated Gas Renewables and Energy Solutions  Around the world countries and companies including Shell are adopting netzero emissions targets and seeking to create lowercarbon energy systems As the cleanestburning fossil fuel natural gas and LNG have a central role to play in delivering the energy the world needs and helping power progress towards these targets  Shell definitely has some skin in the game Earlier this month the AngloDutch supermajor announced its most ambitious makeover in its centuryold history It is throttling back oil production as it inches toward a lowcarbon future but for natural gas the global opportunities abound The percentage of total gas in Shell s portfolio  is expected to rise to around 55 or more  by the end of the decade CEO Ben van Beurden told investors at the time As global gas consumption expands Shell also may be eyeing a plethora of opportunities The latest LNG analysis is forecasting a supplydemand gap opening around 2025 with less production coming onstream than previously projected Shell estimated that only 3 mmt in new LNG production capacity was announced in 2020 down from an expected 60 mmt researchers noted This year it is looking stronger For example Shell s frequent partner and No 1 gas producer Qatar Petroleum this month said it was sanctioning its largest LNG expansion ever at the massive North Field US projects also may move forward For example Houstonbased NextDecade Corp has said it plans to reach a final investment decision this year on  a minimum of two trains  at the proposed export terminal in South Texas Wood Mackenzie also has estimated that  11 billion of Australian gas projects could be sanctioned this year CarbonNeutral Gains Last year gas demand rebounded in Asia China and India following the outbreak of the pandemic Shell data showed China increased its LNG imports in 2020 by an estimated 11 from 2019 or 7 mmt to 67 mmt  China s announcement of a target to become carbonneutral by 2060 is expected to continue driving up its LNG demand  researchers noted LNG is forecast to play a  key role  in decarbonizing China s  hardtoabate sectors namely buildings heavy industry shipping and heavyduty road transport  Meanwhile India increased LNG imports by 11 yearyear in 2020 as it took advantage of lower prices to supplement domestic gas production  Two other major Asian LNGimporting countries  Japan and South Korea  also announced netzero emissions targets in 2020  researchers noted Those targets should lead to more gas consumption For example to meet its netzero target South Korea plans to switch 24 coalfired power plants to LNG by 2034 researchers said Meanwhile European demand alongside  flexible US supply helped to balance the global LNG market in the first half of 2020  according to Shell  However supply outages in other basins structural constraints and extreme weather later in the year resulted in higher prices  By 2040 global LNG demand is estimated to hit 700 mmt driven by a 75 surge in Asian growth  For instance China s heavyduty transport sector consumed nearly 13 mmt of LNG in 2020 almost doubling from 2018 to serve the fastgrowing fleet of well over 500000 LNGfueled trucks and buses  researchers said  LNGfueled shipping is also growing with the number of vessels expected to more than double with bunkering vessels set to reach 45 by 2023  Shell is looking to find an advantage in that sector The producer already has chartered four newbuild lowemission tankers that are scheduled for delivery beginning in mid2024  According to estimates more than half of future LNG demand will come from countries with netzero emissions targets  researchers said  The LNG industry will need to innovate at every stage of the value chain to lower emissions and play a key role in
