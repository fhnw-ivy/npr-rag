1323,Orsted's Green Plans Lag Its Peers,2021-06-04,,"[""Danish utility Orsted intends to spend over $ 57 billion on renewables and low-carbon technologies by the end of 2027 in a bid to establish itself as a `` global green energy major. '' But the ambitious target, revealed last week, still lags that of a number of its European utility peers, as well as oil and gas companies positioning themselves for the energy transition ( WGI Nov.18'20). Orsted is now eyeing 50 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity by 2030. That is roughly in line with BP, which has set a `` net developed '' renewable capacity target of 20 GW by 2025 and 50 GW by 2030. But it's less than TotalEnergies, which is targeting 35 GW by 2025 and 100 GW by 2030, or other European utilities such as Spain's Iberdrola and Italy's Enel. Iberdrola says it will spend €150 billion ( $ 183 billion) on having 95 GW of installed renewable capacity by 2030 ( WGI Mar.3'21). Enel wants 145 GW operational by that date. Orsted became a pure renewables player in 2017 after selling its oil and gas business. It has become a world leader in offshore wind, betting heavily on the technology over the past decade when some of its peers dismissed it as too expensive. Its new plan increases by 50% the expenditure pledge made at Orsted's last capital markets day in 2018 and quadruples existing renewables capacity of 12 GW. Playing to its strengths, the company will devote the lion's share of spending to offshore wind. It plans to add 22.5 GW to existing operational capacity of 7.5 GW. It has 17.3 GW of firm capacity in the pipeline, either under construction or in late-stage development, and must progress a further 12.7 GW. Growth markets include the US, the Baltic states, the Nordic region and Asia. With 68 GW in potential projects, there are plenty of options on the table. The company says the growing offshore wind market will allow it to be `` selective, '' and that `` early moves enable Orsted to leverage its development expertise and avoid excessive premiums as markets/projects mature '' ( WGI Feb.24'21). Orsted expects offshore wind to be the fastest-growing renewable technology over the next decade. It puts annual growth at roughly 20%, and sees installed capacity jumping from 24 GW in 2020 to more than 170 GW in 2030. The EU expects 60 GW to be built by 2030, while the US has a nonbinding target of 30 GW. Still, the International Energy Agency says the pace of growth remains below levels needed to reach net-zero emissions by midcentury. In addition, the company intends to expand in onshore wind and solar photovoltaics to become a `` top 10 '' global onshore renewables player, with 17.5 GW of operational capacity by 2030. The US, Europe and Asia are all seen as growth markets. Some 4.7 GW of mainly onshore wind and solar PV capacity is operational, and roughly 10 GW is `` substantiated, '' leaving 2 GW-3 GW of projects to be found. It wants to split the capacity 50-50, versus 70% onshore wind now, reflecting customer preferences for solar-based corporate power purchase agreements. Orsted also wants to become a global leader in green fuels and green hydrogen -- produced from renewables -- to displace fossil fuel-based hydrogen in refineries and ammonia production, and for use in new areas like steel and heavy transport. It has more than 3 GW of electrolyzer capacity in the pipeline ( WGI Jun.17'20). Projects have been proposed in Denmark, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway and the UK, some linked to huge offshore wind farms. But it warns that `` regulatory mandates or incentives for green fuels '' will be required to unlock renewable hydrogen and green fuels projects in Europe, and a customer base must be built up ( WGI Oct.7'20).""]",energyintel,https://www.energyintel.com/0000017b-a7dd-de4c-a17b-e7df67720000

[ Build ] a 100 x 100 array of 10MW [ wind ] turbines and you get 100GW – which you will need to marry to [ industrial scale ] stationary [ energy ] storage, ” he said.', '“ We must have a clear path for a sustainable energy future [ based ] on hydro [ power ], geothermal, wind, solar. ”', 'However, Musk stressed that due to the global energy crisis now unfolding, a ramp-up of hydrocarbon production was necessary in the short-term.', '“ I don’ t tend to demonise oil and gas. These are necessary right now if civilisation is going to function. At this point in time, I actually think we need more oil and gas, not less... but simultaneously moving as fast as we can to a sustainable energy economy. ”', 'At the same time Musk said he expects “ tremendous change over the next five, 10, 15 years ”, including foreseeing half of all cars coming off the assembly line in 2030 being electric.', '“ The transition to sustainable energy industry hinges on the rate of battery production [ that the world can achieve ], he noted.', 'Musk said despite the current pace of the energy transition being off-track to meet the Paris Agreement target of keeping global heating to a 1.5℃ rise above pre-industrial levels that “ things are improving exponentially in terms of sustainable energy ”, adding “ but if we can make it go faster, then all the better ”.', '“ If the stakes are important enough then you take the risks [ of accelerating the transition ].', 'He added: “ What will actually happen [ in the energy transition ] is an ‘ S-curve’ – an exponential increase, then linear, then logarithmic – true of any large industrial transition. ”', 'The International Energy Agency forecasts that the build-out of offshore wind plant could reach 2TW or more by 2050, creating a $ 1trn-plus market.', 'Recharge is part of DN Media Group.

16584,Germany Threatens To Derail EU Green Deal Over Fossil Car Phaseout,2023-03-03,,"['The “ Climate Chancellor ” needs to draw a line between national disputes and what has already been agreed with Germany’ s international partners.', 'The German Transport Minister has threatened that the government will abstain from an EU vote to end the sale of new combustion engine cars and vans from 2035. EU governments and the European Parliament reached an agreement on the 2035 deadline last year after Germany’ s FDP party said it would support the law.', 'A final vote by ministers on the deal had been planned for Tuesday ( 7th March) and was expected to be a formality. But it has been postponed, with no new date given for when a vote will be taken by the European Council. If the FDP’ s threat that Germany will abstain is carried out, it will block a key part of the European Green Deal — the EU’ s plan to become climate neutral in 2050. Cars are responsible for 12% of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. A 2035 phaseout of internal combustion cars and vans in the EU would save almost 2 Gt of CO2 emissions by 2050, an analysis by green group Transport & Environment ( T & E) shows.', 'Julia Poliscanova, senior director for vehicles and emobility at T & E, said: “ The FDP are turning Europe’ s engine phase-out into a battle for the soul of Germany’ s governing coalition. By blocking the most progressive climate legislation in the world, the Liberals risk not only the breakup of the coalition but Germany’ s credibility on the world stage.', '“ The FDP’ s cry for e-fuels is about domestic political point scoring after a series of election defeats. Championing the internal combustion engine might play well to their base, but it will give the advantage to the US and China, which are threatening to overtake Europe with massive investments in electric cars and batteries.', '“ The self-proclaimed Climate Chancellor must now make clear that Germany is a reliable international partner. If the combustion engine phase-out is overturned, the failure of EU climate policy will forever be associated with Olaf Scholz. The Chancellor already supported the agreement back in November when concessions were made for Germany.

17198,Does The Tesla Cybertruck Have Serious Problems?,2023-06-10,,"['The Tesla Cybertruck was introduced to shock and awe, disgust and obsession, in late 2019. It was supposed to be delivered to customers starting in 2021, but as we all know, it’ s not on the market yet. The explanation has been simple — there weren’ t enough batteries for existing models to sell out ( the Model Y and Model 3), so what’ s the point in producing a new model. However, there may be other reasons as well, and some news out this week about the Cybertruck alpha implies that there may be more to it than all that.', 'As you may recall, a lot of Tesla documents were leaked in Germany to the major news outlet Handelsblatt. As part of those documents, it was apparently revealed that the Cybertruck alpha was full of issues, issues concerning the suspension, braking, handling, body sealing, noise levels, and more. Naturally, there are a couple of potential explanations at play here. One is that the vehicle was simply in a very early stage of development and it was not considered important to make sure these things were refined — and there’ s perhaps nothing at all to be concerned about in that case. Another explanation is that there are critical problems with Cybertruck design and development, and those may not be resolved yet and may not be resolved soon. Frankly, we don’ t know which of these two explanations is valid — or if there’ s perhaps a middle explanation that involves a bit of both.', 'A veteran automotive engineer who looked through the report on these issues noted that Tesla should be able to address them all — it’ s got the money to pour into getting the Cybertruck right. However, “ my first reaction is I am astounded. These are classic mechanical automotive engineering challenges that you have in pretty much any vehicle. I’ m blown away that they would be struggling so much with the basics. ”', 'Tesla Cybertruck, Petersen Automotive Museum. Photo by Kyle Field | CleanTechnica', 'While some are concerned, or feign concern, that the Cybertruck alpha is “ leaky, noisy, and has poor handling and braking, ” as Wired reports; former Nissan COO and Aston Martin Lagonda CEO Andy Palmer notes, “ It’ s an alpha-stage vehicle, so it’ s not surprising that it’ s some way off its targets. ” However, he also says that it’ s abnormal to put that scathing of an assessment into a written report, due to the potential of it being leaked … as it was. “ You’ d be giving the engineers that wrote this stuff a good bollocking. You don’ t normally write this down. ”', 'Also, while the general idea is that all these issues can get worked out before the production vehicle arrives, there is concern that it’ s not so straightforward. The problems with seals can present issues keeping out rain, wind, and noise; and the report states “ there are a number of areas that we do not have a clear path to sealing. ” That’ s not good. “ Data in the report shows that the alpha version was significantly noisier than engineers had projected based on their designs, ” Wired states, “ and that testers had identified 21 potential noise leaks in the body of the vehicle.', 'There are also concerns about braking, torsional stiffness, and other things. “ The brake performance seems serious. I’ m surprised they’ re not further forward, ” Palmer says. “ So to be only on prototype parts at this stage is quite late. ”', 'The automotive production industry has evolved to be more effective and more efficient for more than a century, with millions of new vehicles a year getting created from more and more refined manufacturing processes. The Cybertruck can benefit from many of those too, but there’ s no denying that it does a lot differently and there may be more challenges in design and production than we presume off the bat.', 'We’ ll see. The Cybertruck is supposed to truly be in production in 2024. We don’ t have too long to wait in order to see how a production version of the Cybertruck actually turns out and whether any of these early issues remain issues or it’ s all just another case of overhyped FUD ( fear, uncertainty, and doubt).', 'One thing we know is that the alpha version is not the final version. Much gets done between the alpha version of a new model being produced and the first consumer versions being produced. I wouldn’ t panic about Cybertruck issues at this point, but I do think it’ s worth making this note in case it’ s a topic to come back to in a year or two.', ""Zach is tryin ' to help society help itself one word at a time.

6728,Five ways for the energy industry to shift the dial on inclusion in 2023,2023-01-04,,"['I remember once being in a queue at a newsagent in Croydon, London when a gentleman approached me with the excitement of someone who had just discovered they were the heir to a huge fortune and said, “ This is the end of racism! ”.', 'It was November 5, 2008 and like many around the world, viewers in the UK – myself included – had been glued to their screens to see Barack Obama declared as the first black President of the United States of America.', 'The promise of that historic event was reflected in the hope on this man’ s face. “ Well, the beginning of the end ”, I replied. Looking back on that day more than 14 years ago and thinking of the deeper concerns around the race conversation in the USA and around the world, I was right to temper my optimism with caution.', 'Since then, there has been a greater outcry and most objective observers admit that event has done little to shift the dial on the racial equity. The moments that are at first seen as watersheds become fleeting at best, leading us all to doubt that true change is possible.', 'These sentiments are not new; they are reflected in the words of writer Jean-Baptise Alphonse Karr ( “ la plus ca change, plus c’ est la meme chose ”) which written in English mean, “ the more things change, the more they stay the same ”.', 'The same can be said of the increased conversation after the tragic murder of George Floyd and the broadening of the diversity conversation that followed. There is no doubt that some companies made advances. At AFBE-UK, we have seen our membership grow to almost 70 corporate partners and while this is encouraging, there is still a long road to travel.', 'Real progress involves cultivating an environment that is psychologically safe and enabling enough for people to give their best at work. It’ s about ensuring that our organisations reflect, at all levels the communities in which we operate.', 'I have seen first-hand the dance of persuasion that many equality, diversity and inclusion ( ED & I) champions must do with the stakeholders to get the go-ahead for initiatives.', 'The truth is that in most companies, the responsibility for cultural change rest on the shoulders of particularly passionate individuals or on the HR department by default. These committed individuals either move on, get promoted or burn out and give up, all the changes they sought to make get undone and we are left wondering why “ …things stay the same ”.', 'In the meantime, we encounter business challenges that would be mitigated in an inclusive environment where every voice counts and fail to connect the dots. Having seen this happen repeatedly in organisations, it’ s hard not to be sceptical about change being truly possible. It’ s no wonder the civil rights campaigner Angela Davis described ED & I as the “ difference that doesn’ t make a difference ”', 'For lasting change to occur, companies must move away from the “ volunteer-based or CSR ” model and instead draw lessons from the world of safety. This means businesses ensuring that inclusivity is interwoven into all of its facets and is included in its performance indicators i.e., is viewed as a key part of what makes a business work.', 'So, what does change look like? I believe there are 5Cs that will help your company shift the dial in the New Year.', 'The first is Candour, by which I mean an open and honest conversation. about how the business is doing and how all employees truly feel about your efforts. This should not only include people from minority groups but employees from the majority who may fear the zero-sum game in which the proposed changes stand to disadvantage them.', 'The second is Cohesion; far too often companies engage in divergent efforts to achieve the same goal. Efforts on inclusion are also rarely tied to business performance. This makes it impossible to monitor the impact of our efforts. For example – does your plan for long-term diversity include STEM outreach to young pupils in your area or does it begin with graduate intake? Is your company seeking to understand how cognitive diversity is helping the business reach better outcomes? Does your work on diversity extend to your supply chain? Do middle managers see diversity as a tool for better outcomes, or just a nice-to-have? Without these considerations we will have plenty of activity but little productivity.', 'The third is Consistency which involves sustained effort in doing actions repeatedly.

16163,Europe's Energy Crisis Will Be Short-Lived & Reap Benefits,2022-09-09,,"['Anytime anyone uses the term ‘ energy independence’, correct them to ‘ strategic energy interdependence’.', 'Energy independence is one of those phrases that’ s casually thrown around that gets right up my nose. In the 21st Century, it’ s a meaningless concept. Vast amounts of energy cross borders constantly, just as iPhones, cars, and jelly beans do. Further, it’ s frequently used in arguments against renewables, as if oil, gas, and coal are somehow magically different. And in the context of Europe, it’ s being heavily abused by many of the usual suspects.', 'But let’ s start with the European energy crisis. It’ s a perfect storm. About 2.5 years ago I predicted that natural gas would end its dozen years of low-priced stability. At the time, the Saudi Arabian-Russian price war was clearly aimed at high-cost oil extraction, and a great deal of natural gas in the world was being pumped from shale oil deposits as a side effect of unconventional oil extraction. Fracking and shale oil extraction in the US and elsewhere had already been proving to be much less profitable than projected in rosy forecasts, and by the end of 2019, foreclosures on outstanding debt and actual seizing of assets by banks was under way. The combination meant that there were a lot fewer fracking firms running, and natural gas from shale oil was drying up. Less supply and less ability to ramp up supply quickly as needed was obviously going to combine to create higher prices and a return to volatility of the commodity.', 'That said, while I, along with McKinsey and others, did predict natural gas prices rising above those of inflation and becoming more volatile, the degree of global volatility surprised me as did the high prices toward the end of 2021. And, of course, my cracked, milky crystal ball didn’ t account for the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the dangerous dependency Europe had formed on natural gas from what has become a pariah state.', 'But this summer’ s European energy crisis is about more than just Russia’ s gas. After Fukushima and its likely trillion USD economic cost, Germany looked at the amazing growth of renewables, the very strong grid reliability that they were maintaining, and decided that it was finally time to let nuclear go. It closed some reactors immediately, and scheduled more for additional closure. At the time and subsequently my opinion has remained the same: I wish that it had closed coal plants instead, but that it is at over 40% reduction in total national annual GHGs since peak gives the country a pass. I live in Canada, after all, and we have done nowhere near that well. Glass houses and all that.', 'Naturally nuclear advocates have been pointing at Germany’ s closure of its nuclear fleet as a major problem in recent months. And, of course, they point to intermittency of renewables as a problem. However, as late as 2017, nuclear-heavy France was a net importer of 14 TWh of electricity from Germany, and Germany was a net exporter to several other countries as well. France was a net exporter to Germany in 2019 and 2020 as Germany reduced its coal generation and stopped exporting as much electricity.', 'But now France is facing a perfect storm. First, its reactors are getting old, with a mean age of over 36 years. Only seven of the 56 reactors are under 30 years old. Reactors typically require a very substantive refurbishment around 40 years of age, and that refurbishment is being compared in cost to much cheaper wind and solar in many jurisdictions, with nuclear plants being retired instead of given a hip replacement and put back to work for another 20 years.', 'Older reactors require increasing amounts of maintenance. A variety of critical components degrade due to heat and radiation, and must be replaced. Various forms of steel embrittlement are a concern that must be monitored. And maintenance on reactors is a big deal. It’ s not like driving your car in for an oil change. Standard maintenance is scheduled years in advance. Many of France’ s reactors are offline due to required, scheduled maintenance that was budgeted and planned long before the energy crisis. Refueling is a requirement every 18–24 months, as an example.', 'COVID-19 disrupted a bunch of scheduled maintenance, and it was deferred until 2022, with no expectation that Ukraine would be invaded by Russia, leading to destabilization of Europe’ s gas heavy energy system. Two strategic disruptors exposed the challenge of the nuclear fleet.', 'France has 56 nuclear reactors, and many of them were offline for scheduled refueling. Some were offline for refueling and maintenance. One was offline for 10-year refurbishment. 18 of 56, a third of the fleet, are offline on pre-existing and COVID deferred schedules.', 'However, that problem with aging reactors I mentioned is kicking the French fleet’ s butt. A group of France’ s reactors, the N4 series, has experienced unexpected corrosion on critical pipes. That’ s taken another 12 reactors offline unexpectedly this year. 30 of France’ s 56 reactors are currently offline, some of them due to deferred work from 2020 and 2021, and over a third is unplanned due to corrosion.', 'That’ s adding substantially to Europe’ s energy crisis. It’ s not just that natural gas was very expensive and that was hitting energy prices, but the relatively stably priced ( and low carbon) French nuclear was down for the count.', 'Naturally, this led to a lot of renewables advocates to point out the intermittency problem of nuclear, and to lay the blame for the energy crisis in Europe at France’ s feet.', 'European energy strategists were seduced by cheap natural gas flowing through massive pipelines from an increasingly rogue state even though natural gas was still a major global warming problem. Instead of concentrating on building a lot more renewables a lot more quickly, they built a lot of gas plants instead, asserting that gas was a major win over coal in terms of greenhouse gas emissions.', 'Except it isn’ t. There’ s been a lot of work done on upstream methane emissions in the past few years, with two major lifecycle cost assessments on ‘ blue’ hydrogen with both noting upstream methane emissions. The Bauer, et al., paper uses a median of 1.5% upstream emissions while the Howarth/Jacobson one, relying more on US data, uses 3.5%. Given that methane has a global warming potential from 20-82 times that of CO2, those upstream emissions add up.', 'A MWh of electricity generated with natural gas in modern higher efficiency gas plants emits about 0.4 metric tons of CO2. The upstream emissions of methane using the 1.5% upstream emissions and the 20 year GWP equates to another 0.4 tons of CO2e. Total CO2e is 0.8 tons for a MWh, which is much closer to coal generation per MWh than most realize. Using 3.5%, of course, upstream emissions is about 0.93 tons of CO2e resulting in 1.33 tons CO2e for a MWh of gas generation, even worse than coal. Europe’ s average is better than the United States on this, but neither looks remotely like a climate solution.', 'The natural-gas-as-bridge-fuel crowd have some explaining to do, as do the blue hydrogen crowd.', 'And so we have fingers pointing wildly in all directions among advocates for one technology or the other. As I’ ve written many times, I’ m pleased with every new nuclear plant China commissions, while being very clear that it is building a lot more wind and solar a lot more quickly and cheaply, and that its nuclear program isn’ t meeting its targets while wind and solar are vastly exceeding theirs. And I would prefer existing nuclear plants in jurisdictions like the US be bridged to retirement, preferably through regulatory changes that enable them to be used more flexibly on grids.', 'My argument against nuclear is that we have now 8 years to massively decarbonize our grids, and modern nuclear plants take 10 years to build once started, at least in the west. South Korea did better, but of course it also had massive corruption, substandard parts installed in its nuclear fleet surrounded by tens of millions of citizens, and major political and corporate figures jailed due in part to their nuclear malfeasance.', 'Many jurisdictions are reconsidering nuclear at present, something I consider mostly ill advised given how fast we have to decarbonize the majority of our electricity. I know that Jigar Shah, head of the US DOE loans program office, considers the newly experienced nuclear construction workers who worked on Vogtle and the abandoned Summer nuclear plants to be an advantage out of those deeply expensive failures, as trained nuclear construction resources are very thin on the ground in the west, but I also know that many of them are heading up to Ontario to work on the likely-to-fail-differently small modular reactor design and construction project at Bruce Nuclear. The ability to train up a new generation of highly skilled, deeply educated, and security clearance enabled workers for nuclear construction is a major headwind for the technology.', 'But let’ s return to energy independence. It’ s being bandied about in the European context right now, even as the new German Chancellor is on a global tour, hat in hand, begging for LNG and hydrogen.', 'No country is capable of being fully developed with a high standard of living at present without trading massive amounts of virtually everything across borders. And yet, energy independence remains a term considered a reasonable one to use, or even a strategic thing to strive toward.', 'Oil and gas flow in all directions today. Electricity crosses the imaginary lines on maps on every continent in the world. Electrons flow from northern Quebec to New York, and from Morocco to Portugal. China’ s Supergrid is massive and expanding. Serious proposals exist for undersea cables from Australia to Singapore and Morocco to the UK. China proposed a trans-polar HVDC grid.', 'Any yet, a fairly regular refrain I hear from anti-renewables types, whether they are promoting nuclear energy or fossil fuels, is that electricity transmission across borders can’ t be relied upon and hedged for risks. This was annoying even before the invasion of Ukraine and the isolation of Russia started, but it’ s even more annoying now. Some of it, of course, is simply because they are stuck on the primary energy fallacy, where they assume that we have to replace all primary energy used in our economy at the same scale, instead of electrifying everything possible so that we only have to replace energy services.', 'The better term is “ strategic energy interdependence. ” In that context, a full set of factors including geopolitics, emerging kleptocracies, and oil and gas regions threatened by climate disruptions starts to reshape how energy should be considered. Let’ s look at the examples of Europe, France, and Germany through that lens.', 'First, if France is considered in isolation, it has too much nuclear power in its mix, 75% of demand. As soon as it’ s considered as a strategically interdependent entity well-linked to the rest of Europe with transmission and electricity markets, its nuclear generation, relatively inflexible due to economics and technology, is not a concern. In 2020, France generated about 340 TWh of electricity from its nuclear fleet, while Europe as a whole generated 2,664 TWh. France was a solid provider of about 13% of Europe’ s low-carbon energy, an amount easily balanced on the interdependent grid.', 'Similarly, Germany’ s massive expansion of renewables, now over 40% of annual demand with wind energy being the largest component, is trivially easy to balance with hydropower from Scandinavia, nuclear from France, and wind energy from Spain. ( As a side note, France’ s nuclear proponents tend to downplay Germany’ s GHG emission reductions compared to France’ s lower ones, but Germany has a bigger economy and a bigger industrial sector, so it has about 1.8 times the industrial emission as France, a serious consideration in its decarbonization results.)', 'Germany, France, Norway, Sweden, and in fact every western European country with the possible exception of Britain are solid, reliable, and stable trading partners. Strategic energy interdependence among these countries is very reasonable.', 'While France’ s nuclear woes are a problem, France is acting quickly to get many of these reactors on line again, something fairly straightforward for ones being refueled or undergoing minor maintenance, although not the dozen reactors in the N4 series. And Europe’ s natural gas reserves are 82.5% refilled already, above the 80% target for October 1, the beginning of heating season. All of Europe’ s states are working on efficiency programs to reduce demand.', 'None of the European countries could have stabilized their energy demands vs supply without the rest of them. Energy independence is a myth, and strategic energy interdependence is the norm. Jurisdictions like Texas and Ontario that are still trying to maintain energy independence are wasting money, emitting more CO2 than necessary and putting their citizens at unnecessary risk ( especially Texas).', 'And so, I ask you for the following favor. Anytime anyone uses the term ‘ energy independence’, correct them to ‘ strategic energy interdependence’, and if necessary, explain why.

Investors are becoming increasingly vocal and insistent about what they expect from the sector.

It is still less than a tenth of its planned capital expenditure, but such a commitment would have been unthinkable even a year ago. Yet its CEO added that the company would rather pay out dividends to shareholders “ so they can plant trees ” than build more renewable energy capacity. Such defensive statements have often been followed by more ambitious plans a few months later.', 'Meanwhile, the court case that forced Royal Dutch Shell to cut its emissions by 45% by 2030 has been followed by ABP, one of the Netherlands’ biggest pension funds being sued in an attempt to make it sell its fossil fuel shares.', 'Shell initially said that it would comply with the ruling but is now appealing. “ We agree urgent action is needed and we will accelerate our transition to net zero, ” said CEO Ben van Beurden. “ But we will appeal because a court judgment, against a single company, is not effective. ”', 'Nonetheless, the sector can expect more climate change litigation in the months ahead.', 'As always, mergers and acquisitions deal activity slowed to a trickle over the summer, but according to Pricewaterhousecoopers ( PwC), “ global decarbonisation coupled with plentiful capital and an economy emerging from the pandemic will continue to drive strong M & A activity through the rest of 2021.

Plans are in the pipeline, and companies like Qcells with its vertically integrated plans for Georgia, First Solar and Enel Green Power have all made significant announcements, but they’ ll take time and won’ t come close to being able to supply the US’ 30-40GW deployment predictions for 2023.', 'As far as the guidance suggests, solar modules and their components are subject to the 40% /55% requirement, including cells, wafers, glass, encapsulant and frames. Components like trackers and inverters are also included. A separate criterion exists for steel products, which must be 100% US-manufactured. This would apply to steel racking in a PV array but not to steel included in any of the module components.', 'Speaking to PV Tech Premium, Sagar Chopra, senior research analyst at energy insight company Wood Mackenzie points out that: “ The guidance also does not address the electrical balance of system components like transformers, switchgear and cables which are key manufactured products that are essential parts of the PV system the requirements. ”', 'Woodmac says that there are “ a few ” domestic manufacturers of these balance of system products in the US, but it could not confirm specific numbers. If these were included in the domestic content criteria, it might become easier to meet the 40% threshold on a cost basis, particularly for developers and asset owners. Chopra also cites the electrical balance of system sundries as a potential factor in the way companies might find novel ways to make the domestic content requirements more achievable, but that clarification is still needed.', 'He emphasises the potential significance of aluminium manufacturing, to produce frames for modules. Heliene has a partnership with a company that produces its frames in both the US and Canada, but Pochtaruk says that the industry as a whole is not set up to produce them on a large scale.', '“ The aluminium industry in the US and Canada is highly protected with trade actions, so the price in the US and in Canada is higher than most countries on earth. It has been very difficult to find aluminium extruders interested in making frames for modules. It’ s just kilometres and kilometres of the same extrusion, there’ s nothing interesting or expensive about it so they don’ t feel compelled to take the business. ”', 'Tracker manufacturing is present in the US through Nextracker’ s steel component facilities, but inverter production is somewhat limited besides Enphase’ s recently opened facility in South Carolina.', 'From a developer’ s perspective, US developer Silicon Ranch tells PV Tech Premium: “ recently released IRA guidance has raised several questions, notably around how to determine what constitutes domestically manufactured products, that make it challenging to assess how the rules apply to projects currently in development or construction. While the IRA stands to be one of the most significant pieces of legislation for domestic manufacturing and the transition to renewable energy, these challenges put at risk the nature of what its authors intended. ”', 'The cell is by far the most expensive part of the solar module – Pochtaruk says that it represents around 50% of the price of a module on average. Without domestic cell capacity in particular the domestic content adder may be obsolete for solar PV.', 'PV Tech’ s head of research Finlay Colville published a series of features saying as much in the last few months, discussing the need for the IRA to prioritise solar cell manufacturing and whether a 100GW cell foundry is could be the way to wrest some control of the global supply chain back to the states from China.', 'Pochtaruk says of Heliene’ s operations: “ With no US made solar cells or solar glass, even when all other module components are domestically produced and assembled, like Heliene’ s, they only provide around 17 or 18 cents of the costs added by developers toward their 40% calculation. ”', 'Under the guidance, a ‘ Manufactured Product’ is considered to be made-in-America if: “ ( 1) all of the manufacturing processes for the Manufactured Product take place in the United States; and ( 2) all of the Manufactured Product Components of the Manufactured Product are of US origin. ”', 'In effect, this means that if any included ‘ Manufactured Product Component’ of a module ( cell, glass, encapsulant, wafers, frames etc.) is imported to the US, the module is no longer considered a US-made product. In the overwhelming majority of cases in the US, a fully-US made module isn’ t currently possible.', 'As a result, manufacturers would be required to disclose their entire pricing stack for every component that has gone into the module in order to prove compliance with the 40% threshold. “ It’ s going to be a big ask from manufacturers to reveal their pricing structures including manufacturing costs, overheads and margins, ” Sagar Chopra says. “ The calculation for domestic content is cost-based, manufacturers must provide full transparency on their cost stack and margin levels, which is impractical and inconvenient for manufacturers. ”', 'Some manufacturers – like Heliene – already do this, but it remains to be seen whether the majority of companies will play ball. Solar supply chains are increasingly under scrutiny and whilst manufacturers will likely be looking for ways to secure and clean up their supplies, the process of sourcing and breaking down costs to pass benefit onto their customers may be cumbersome.', '“ We sell ‘ cost plus’, ” Pochtaruk says, “ So we issue our clients with the costs, the only thing we fix is the margin. To be able to do that you need to disclose your exact costs, component by component…you’ re basically opening the kimono for everybody to look. We’ re fine with that. ”', 'According to Chopra: “ A 10% bonus credit is attractive, but it remains to be seen how competitive domestic components are against imported goods and whether the 10% bonus adder is attractive to offset any premiums from sourcing domestically. ”', 'US-made products are going to be more expensive than imports, on the whole. Most PV modules – around 80% – come into the US from Southeast Asia where predominantly Chinese manufacturers have set up factories and supply chains. These are generally going to be cheaper than domestic products.', 'The long-running saga around the anti-dumping and countervailing duty tariffs is rooted in this disparity and what the US sees as unfair price manipulation, and subsequently market domination, by Chinese made or owned modules.', '“ A Chinese cell you can buy at 12/23 cents per watt, ” Pochtaruk says, “ but a cell that you import in the US, made outside of China with non-Xinjiang polysilicon, is roughly 20 cents. ”', 'The question then comes down to whether the 10% is worth it compared with the premium for domestic products and the already increased prices that developers are paying for US-approved imports. The smaller the project, generally the higher the overall price per watt for installation and materials. A rooftop or community solar installation might then see a 10% price cut as too big to ignore. Pochtaruk tells PV Tech Premium that Heliene is seeing average install costs of around US $ 1.60 per watt for rooftops and closer to US $ 1.20 for community solar, which would see a 12-16 cent saving on every installed watt of power.', 'A utility-scale project would be under a dollar per watt, and as such the extra work at all levels may not be worthwhile for a 10% discount.', 'Pochtaruk continues: “ We’ re seeing that for developers installing community solar up to 5MW and rooftops – which is a few GW a year – and commercial and industrial, to leave it on the table is a lot of money. ”', 'The domestic content adders are ultimately tied to the availability of supply in the US, which is currently subject to time. Silicon Ranch explains their position as a developer: “ In the long-term, our company is well-positioned to leverage the IRA due to a pre-existing commitment we made to source materials as locally as possible, both in an effort to guarantee supply as well as optimise the positive economic impacts our projects can have on the local communities and regions in which they are located. ”', '“ The long-term ” might be key here. Like Heliene’ s relatively small-scale US aluminium partnership, Silicon Ranch has made what look like concerted efforts to establish domestic partnerships and supply wherever possible. They have module supply agreements aplenty with First Solar – who produce a fair proportion of their Cadmium Telluride thin-film panels in the US – as well as Nextracker.', 'But the domestic content guidance as it stands is quite unclear, and the time that it will take for capacity to come online across the solar value chain in the US will probably make it difficult for developers and manufacturers to participate and meet the requirements of the adder.', 'For analysis of the implications for domestic content in the battery energy storage industry, see our sister publication EnergyStorage.news.']",pv-tech,https://www.pv-tech.org/its-going-to-be-a-big-ask-iras-domestic-content-adders-leave-the-pv-industry-with-questions/

The report also found that while the solar industry is more diverse than some other energy industries, the overall energy workforce lags in Hispanic ( 17%), Black ( 8%), and Indigenous worker ( 1%) representation.

Emory has already installed solar arrays across many buildings on its main campus and is nearing completion of a solar canopy PV project at its Musculoskeletal Institute off-campus. Ben Damiani, chief technology officer at Cherry Street Energy, is here to share some details on the development and technology used in Emory’ s latest solar endeavor.', 'A written portion of this podcast is below but be sure to listen to the full episode on your favorite podcast service.', 'Cherry Street Energy is a next-generation power company. We look to incorporate all of the power features for the future to make “ Energy 2.0, ” if you will. So that includes solar energy generation on site for commercial and industrial applications, as well as including battery backup, load shifting, electric vehicle infrastructure, resiliency — just what does the next generation of power look like? We try to be very forward thinking in how we deliver the next generation of power. And then for myself, I’ m the chief technology officer and have a long history in solar.', 'Emory has been really forward thinking on trying to reduce their carbon footprint and transition over to renewable energy resources. We’ ve actually partnered with them over the last five years. They want to get 5 MW of solar energy generation by 2026. We’ ve been working on projects — on solar — putting it on their rooftops and then other parking garages to build solar canopies to provide shaded parking areas for this particular project. This is the sixth parking canopy that we have done with Emory.', 'We were used to working with other manufacturers of panels for some of the larger arrays. Panels continue to shift in size, and that always presents an updated design for us. Even though we had done a couple of these designs before with Emory, we had the option to consider some new structures.', 'One of the companies I had worked for in the past mentioned reaching out to PowerShingle and Nucor, and once we started getting into that product, it became really clear that there was something innovative there.', 'It allowed for us to get some new technology built into project that we were looking for. We wanted to provide a weatherproof canopy provide expectation that when you pull under a shade structure that you would also stay dry. So what we were able to find that really made us all have a win-win-win type scenario is as we were looking at the simplified structure with using American-made products with a big trusted company like Nucor, because it’ s a parking deck that’ s up on the fourth floor, people really wanted to feel secure that they had experience and could trust in the products they were getting.', 'Billy Ludt is senior editor of Solar Power World and currently covers topics on mounting, installation and business issues.', 'Infrastructure saving is one of the best and hardest elements architecturally to support and sustain.

6831,Scotland’ s Energy Strategy is irrational,2023-02-13,,"['Getting Scotland’ s energy strategy right is critical not just for those involved in and making a livelihood from the industry but for the consumer and the general economy.', 'The consequences of getting it wrong can have on energy security, resilience and cost – as we’ ve learnt to our cost over recent months – leads to a very poor outcome for both domestic consumers and industry.', 'It’ s also of major importance to the maintenance and growth of a healthy supply chain. A sensible, properly thought through strategy provides pointers to what the supply chain should be putting effort and investment into and what Govt should be targeting in terms of public funds for R & D and other support. It should also enable Govt to provide direction to our universities in terms of what topics they should be putting effort into particularly when it comes to applied energy related research.', 'Above all it should put Scotland’ s interests – economic, social and industrial – first.', 'On all these counts and more I regret to say that in my opinion the Scottish Government’ s draft energy strategy falls very short.', 'Both Ministers Matheson and Harvie have said that the use of hydrogen for heat in Scottish homes depends on what the UK policy will be. This is a sad reminder that energy policy is not devolved so designing a strategy that’ s suited to Scotland’ s particular circumstances is in fact pretty much impossible. Some may then ask “ so why bother developing a separate strategy? ”. It’ s a valid question.', 'Moving to the detail – the idea that Scotland should be producing hydrogen for export but not for use by Scottish homeowners strikes me as obtuse. It’ s also worth noting here that any such production for export will probably involve a large percentage of inward investment. It’ s already been announced that the Scottish Govt has signed a memorandum of understanding with Germany regarding hydrogen production because they have the technology needed and despite the pretence Scotland is a world leader in hydrogen, we absolutely do not.', 'I would also point out that whilst Scotland and the UK prevaricate about hydrogen use, the Dutch and Germans are running hydrogen boiler trials which the Dutch have already claimed are a success. It’ s also well known that whilst many in the UK rail against the use of fuel cell vehicles and in particular private cars, our European friends are rolling out hydrogen stations at an ever increasing rate and European manufacturers are already gearing up for more hydrogen fuel cell vehicle production. There are also numerous hydrogen pipeline and production projects being developed to distribute hydrogen around Europe and Scandinavia. Why do we have to be the outlier?', 'The much discussed “ presumption against new oil and gas developments ” – echoed now by the Labour party I understand – is of course the most ill considered statement of all. That’ s not because it’ s necessarily wrong given the global climate change issues but because in order to take that step and displace oil and gas jobs we need to see some evidence that those tens of thousands of jobs are actually going to be replaced.', 'As of today, no such evidence exists. Anyone connected to the Scottish energy sector knows that the investment in creating those high skill, high value, high wage jobs simply isn’ t happening on anything like the scale it needs to. For example 12 Scottish companies are receiving a share of £560,000 to support the “ decarbonisation of heavy duty vehicles ”. That’ s a mere £46k each! It’ s not a serious move. I’ d have picked one and given them the lot.', '', 'Supporting the “ reskilling ” of oil and gas workers by funding an offshore skills passport isn’ t going to be that helpful either if the jobs don’ t exist in the numbers and sectors they need to be to make best use of those skills. Its cart before horse stuff.', 'What’ s worse is we keep being made false promises to try to keep up the pretence that it will all be all right on the night. So we’ ve now got a couple of Green Freeports in the pipeline and locally to Aberdeen, an Energy Transition Zone.', 'Well guess what folks. Norway didn’ t need any of these to develop and grow its hydrogen electrolyser, fuel cell, hydrogen storage and solar cell manufacturing businesses. Nor, seeing it’ s topical, to successfully build both battery and hydrogen fuel cell powered ferries. Denmark didn’ t need any of these to help them become one of the biggest manufacturers of wind turbines employing nearly 30,000 people or, to also develop their burgeoning hydrogen technology manufacturing sector. For heaven’ s sake, even Estonia, a country with less than half the population of Scotland, has companies manufacturing both electrolysers and fuel cells with the latter being capable of incorporating into combined heat and power units. Frankly, these countries are making us look foolish and immature.', 'We should therefore be highly sceptical of the claims for the numbers of new jobs that will be created. Tony MacKay the eminent Inverness based economist said: “ The proponents of the Cromarty Firth and Inverness Green Freeport claim that it will create up to 25,000 jobs. However, I believe that claim is far too high and that the actual number will be much lower. I had suggested one-tenth of that figure, but even 2500 new jobs may be too high. ”', 'In my opinion this is almost entirely due to the lack of commitment to manufacturing. Not fabrication but high value advanced manufacturing of hardware such as electrolysers and wind turbines and the rest. But, in a remarkable act of self harm it is simply ridiculous to claim as Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government have that Scotland can’ t manufacture electrolysers. But Estonia can?', 'Solving this should really be top of the list in terms of any energy strategy but it doesn’ t even figure. I’ d also suggest it’ s a huge indictment of the capability of our nineteen no doubt “ world beating ” universities.', 'There simply isn’ t even a sniff of a meaningful industrial strategy anywhere in the Scottish Government’ s energy master plan and yet on hydrogen alone it’ s claimed the strategy could lead to “ 70,000-300,000 jobs created or protected by 2045 ”. I have no idea how.', 'Germany’ s Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the recent Davos World Economic Forum: “ Our goal is nothing less than an electrolysis boom ” describing it as “ one of the most important technologies for a climate-neutral world ” and “ the key to decarbonizing our economies. ”. You’ d think this might provide the Scottish Govt with a hint of what actually needs doing.', 'Scotland has of course already abandoned many other sectors to others including wind turbine manufacturing which was a major strategic loss and something which at the time we genuinely did lead the world in. The UK seems intent on making the same sort of mistake with the collapse of British Volt which failed to raise the investment it needed. Scotland does have two small battery makers but they are minnows compared with the big European and other players. One has expertise in sodium ion batteries which is a viable alternative to lithium and we should be nurturing the hell out of it.', 'We also seem to be completely ignoring the other problems we would create if we stop oil and gas production. How would we deal with the production of hydrocarbon free plastic equivalents or pharmaceuticals or the myriad of other products we get from oil and gas that are essential to everyday life? Where is the thinking on this and more importantly where is the R & D that our nineteen universities and supposedly the Net Zero Technology Centre should be involved in? As always I’ m happy to be proven wrong but I’ ve found nothing other than a company that makes compostable coffee cups and associated products in Edinburgh. It’ s brilliant, but it’ s obviously not enough.', 'The argument that’ s being used seems to be that hydrogen should be prioritised for so called “ hard to abate ” industrial applications. That would include for example Liberty Steel, a fertiliser plant in Perth and a cement plant in Dunbar, the Grangemouth refinery, what’ s left of our paper industry, glass manufacturing and of course distilleries. That really isn’ t a lot compared to the emissions from domestic and business premises and transport. The fact that Scotland is no longer a highly industrialised nation means our priorities should be the reverse of what’ s being touted.', 'Any sector that uses heat can be decarbonised using hydrogen and so can most sectors including all forms of transport that are in need of clean, green propulsion. Domestic transport in Scotland still produces the highest amount of greenhouse gases. So why not install green, off-grid hydrogen stations all over Scotland and start emulating our European friends.', 'As was reported recently in the Press & Journal up to 63% of homes in the Highlands are not connected to the gas grid and instead use heating oil and other off-grid fuels and research by the trade association Liquid Gas UK found forcing these homes to upgrade to greener electric systems like heat pumps could cost homeowners up to £32,000. I would add it gives them absolutely no extra energy security.', 'Minister Patrick Harvie says he wants more sustainable options, such as heat pumps. But these are only “ sustainable ” up to the moment a storm damages the grid as happens far more frequently now.', 'The couple of thousand residents on Shetland who lost power for up a to a weeks recently due to snow bringing down power cables would not have benefit from having a heat pump. However, if they’ d had a green off-grid green hydrogen boiler or even better, a hydrogen CHP unit they’ d have remained warm and cosy.', 'Using models developed by Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, Siemens and others, the American company Universal Hydrogen which is working on the use of hydrogen in aviation, published data in January suggesting the global cost of green liquid hydrogen not including subsidies will be below jet fuel ( and far below Sustainable Aviation Fuels) by the mid- to late-2020s and average between $ 1.5 and $ 2 per kg which is equivalent to a gallon of kerosene.']",energyvoice,https://www.energyvoice.com/opinion/478969/scotlands-energy-strategy-is-irrational/

16515,US Clean Energy Goals Hinge On Faster Permitting,2023-02-12,,"['The U.S. Inflation Reduction Act directs unprecedented investment in clean energy development and climate investments — a whopping $ 369 billion or more over the next decade. But finance is just one piece of the puzzle for delivering the country’ s clean energy goals.', 'Building renewable energy and transmission projects in the U.S. at the speed and scale the climate crisis requires will require reforms to the way they’ re sited and permitted — at the federal, state, and local levels.', 'The current timeframes needed to permit, build and interconnect systems are not aligned with the Biden administration’ s target of decarbonizing the power sector by 2035. To reach this goal and mitigate the worst impacts of climate change, the U.S. must double or triple the level of renewable energy deployment and double the expansion of transmission.', 'Meanwhile, one analysis found that the project build time — including permitting, siting, and construction — for utility-scale solar and wind facility projects averages four years. Permitting alone can take years before construction can begin. Transmission lines, which are needed to increase grid resiliency and bring wind and solar energy to their point of use, can take around 10 years to complete — substantially longer than the time needed to develop wind and solar projects.', 'Congress and the administration are focusing on clean energy permitting reform at the federal level, with a particular focus on inter-regional transmission, or power lines that extend across states, which have been very challenging to build. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act of 2021 made some policy changes to expedite permitting and siting, particularly for transmission and offshore wind projects. This included financing assistance for transmission projects and clarifying and strengthening backstop siting authority of the Federal Energy Reform Commission ( FERC) for interstate transmission lines within certain corridors ( known as National Interest Electric Transmission Corridors). This change means that if states do not issue permits within one year for a transmission line within these priority corridors, then FERC can issue the permit.', 'While this was an important step, it’ s far from sufficient and does not address the significant barriers to building interstate transmission. Even under this new change, it could still take many years to build new interstate transmission lines given the myriad other factors involved in financing and building interstate transmission, such as siting and cost allocation. And this backstop siting authority is still less than FERC’ s siting authorities for other assets, namely natural gas pipelines, where the agency has authority over states.', 'Given the challenges to building interstate transmission, further federal action and collaboration across jurisdictional scales is needed. The most visible Congressional effort to date is the stalled Manchin permitting reform proposal. This bill would have created a streamlined permitting system for energy assets, including renewable energy projects and natural gas and fossil projects, and would have authorized specific projects like the Mountain Valley gas pipeline. The proposal also would have allowed the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE) to designate transmission lines in the national interest and enable FERC to allocate the costs of these projects to ratepayers across the region who would benefit from them. While the bill contained controversial provisions and ultimately stalled, transmission issues are a critical topic for federal policymakers to address. Debates on this issue are expected to continue in the 118th Congress.', 'Meanwhile, administrative actions by agencies or the administration may be viable to address some elements of needed permitting reform, such as setting clear or expedited timelines and improving coordination across agencies, although such actions can be changed or reversed by future administrations.', 'The Clear Sky Tampa Bay team worked with the Solar Energy Innovation Network ( SEIN) on siting for solar for severe weather conditions. Photo from the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council', 'But addressing clean energy siting and permitting challenges will require work at multiple jurisdictional scales — not just the federal level. Interconnection policies happen at the utility and regional grid operator level. And much of renewable energy siting falls under state or local jurisdiction. So how can states and cities expedite their renewable power development? Recent examples are helpful in looking for solutions to these problems.', 'States and local governments are critical actors in siting and permitting energy projects. States differ on whether utility-scale renewable energy siting authority predominantly occurs at the state or local level, with some states taking a hybrid approach. States may have rules that give the authority for siting facilities over a certain size to a state entity, usually a public utility commission or a state siting commission. For example, in Ohio, wind projects larger than 5 megawatts ( MW) fall under the jurisdiction of the Ohio Power Siting Board.', 'Many of these state siting commissions and procedures were developed for large generation facilities, such as coal-fired power plants. Further complicating the picture, wind and solar may not be treated uniformly by state and local jurisdictions due to different land use and siting concerns.', 'Some states are beginning to revisit these existing processes for renewable energy and transmission projects in order to meet state clean energy goals. For example, Washington’ s HB 1812 modifies an existing energy siting commission by separating it from the public utility commission, and adds additional study requirements and engagement processes. Other state reforms have been more limited. For example, in 2022, Illinois enacted legislation that limits the ability of local entities such as cities to restrict certain renewable energy projects like wind and establishes minimum setback requirements and height and sound limitations.', 'Two states, California and New York, recently undertook more comprehensive permitting reform, which can offer lessons for other states.', 'New York passed the Accelerated Renewable Energy Growth and Community Benefit Act as part of the 2020-21 state budget ( A9508-B). The Act created the Office of Renewable Energy Siting ( ORES), the nation’ s first dedicated office for siting large renewable energy projects.', 'ORES serves as a one-stop shop for all necessary state permits and environmental reviews for renewable energy projects greater than 25 MW. Slightly smaller projects between 20-25 MW may also opt-in to use the ORES single-permit process. ORES must act upon permit applications within one year for standard projects, and 6 months for projects proposed on certain commercial and industrial sites. The legislation also designates a preference for build-ready or previously developed sites, such as brownfields.', 'The act also amended existing state authorities and gave the state stronger override authority of local laws restricting renewable energy projects between 25-200 MW in size. The ORES process still requires project review and feedback opportunities and consultation with local communities. ORES is directed to consider local laws and regulations, but may ultimately override them if they are “ unreasonably burdensome. ” Localities are then able to hold a public hearing, but may not overturn ORES’ decision.', 'Before ORES, projects over 25 MW were subject to what was known as an “ Article 10 process, ” a multi-stage endeavor requiring approval from the New York State Board on Electric Generation Siting and the Environment. New York’ s renewable energy projects took 5 – 10 years to be completed under Article 10, significantly hindering the build-out of renewable energy.', 'Importantly, the new permitting process also requires projects to provide benefits to their host communities, including financial incentives such as payment in lieu of taxes to compensate local entities for lost tax revenues. The Act also directs the Public Service Commission to determine how to provide compensation to areas for hosting projects, including utility bill credits.', 'And finally, the legislation makes funds available to support intervention in the permitting process. The explicit inclusion of these two elements — benefit-sharing and intervention — address distributive and procedural equity, making sure that communities see tangible benefits to hosting a project and ensuring funds for them to participate in the regulatory process.', 'As part of the 2022 budget process, California enacted AB 205, a budget trailer bill that contains a package of energy-related items. Along with other significant energy items, AB 205 contains substantial changes to clean energy permitting.', 'The reform gives a single agency, the California Energy Commission ( CEC), authority for a consolidated permitting process that replaces all state and local requirements ( with a few exceptions for water quality and coastal permits). The CEC already performs this role for fossil-fuel thermal plants. AB 205 expands this CEC authority to wind, solar and energy storage projects over 50 MW; non-fossil thermal plants such as geothermal; and transmission lines from these projects. The consolidated permit may also be used for wind, solar and energy storage manufacturing facilities. The new authority is opt-in, meaning eligible projects must choose to pursue this streamlined permitting approach.', 'The new process attempts to limit the permitting timeline to roughly one year. Upon receiving an eligible project’ s permit application, the CEC must decide on its completeness within 30 days. The CEC then acts as lead agency for the California Environmental Quality Act ( CEQA) process and must prepare an environmental impact review ( EIR), follow steps for public outreach and Tribal consultation, and host a public meeting as close as possible to the proposed project site once the draft EIR is released.', 'AB 205 sets a time limit for this EIR process, requiring CEQ to determine whether to approve it within 270 days of the completeness finding. The bill also allows for expedited resolution of litigation arising from the EIR process, limiting it to 270 days from the court filing ( with more details on the expedited resolution to be established by December 31, 2023).', 'In order for a permit application to be deemed complete, the project must follow certain labor and prevailing wage standards and have a net-positive economic impact on the local community. The project must also have a written community benefits plan in place with a signatory community partner, such as a local government entity, a community organization, Tribal entities or a social justice organization.', 'These community benefit plans must be written contracts demonstrating mutual benefits, and may include requirements related to job quality and access, workforce training, and community investments such as parks and bike paths.', 'Recent state permitting reforms provide potential lessons for other states and Congress, given the ongoing need for reforms at multiple levels of government. The California and New York permitting reforms share a few common approaches, including:', 'Key to any reforms are mechanisms for early and effective community engagement, as well as consideration of the cumulative impact within communities. A recent Data for Progress memo found high support for community benefits as part of renewable energy project development, such as funding for cleaning up polluted sites, funding for community centers, and programs for youth and seniors. Policymakers should create forums for local stakeholder engagement as part of any centralized permit review process and facilitate early meetings between communities and project developers.', 'These actions, along with complementary reforms at federal and local levels, can be a first step in adjusting permitting practices to build a clean and resilient grid. Actions at the state, federal and local levels will all be necessary to build the clean energy generation and grid infrastructure needed to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.', 'There is not a single definition or standard process for siting and permitting energy projects in the U.S.', 'Siting generally refers to the process of selecting a geographic site for a proposed project.', 'Permitting generally refers to the process of required approvals and review needed to install a project at a site, subject to relevant ordinances.', 'The project location, type, size and other project factors determine the specific permits and approvals needed. Approvals typically involve different authorities, and may include local governments’ land use and zoning restrictions, state and local ordinances specific to renewable energy development ( e.g. setback requirements), grid interconnection agreements, and permits for projects sited on state or federal lands or that impact cultural sites and critical natural resources and habitats. These permitting actions may require environmental impact statements under federal and state laws.', 'The result of the multiple permits needed, and the different review processes and timelines for each one, often results in lengthy timelines.

Even intermittent cloud cover can have a dramatic effect on incident solar energy, while other factors like air temperature, wind direction and speed, precipitation, humidity, and air pressure can all influence the efficiency of solar cells. Monitoring weather conditions accurately is crucial to understand variations in PV plant performance.', 'OTT HydroMet meteorological sensors are tailor-made for commercial and industrial solar PV installations.', 'While variations in weather conditions may be of only passing concern to the average domestic PV user, they are of critical importance for commercial and industrial PV systems.', 'For large installations, even small relative fluctuations in performance can make a huge difference to overall productivity, and any source of output variation must be closely monitored to ensure the overall system is performing optimally.', 'In these cases, meteorological monitoring is essential to determine whether variations in output are due to weather conditions, or indicative of more serious hardware degradation or malfunction.', 'Weather monitoring is, therefore, an essential part of understanding PV system health and scheduling maintenance on time. Analysis of historical data – on precipitation and wind conditions, for example – enables seasonal trends to be uncovered, which can in turn be used to optimize cleaning and maintenance schedules on a seasonal basis.', 'Measurements of solar irradiance are crucial to determine the efficiency of a solar plant. This is usually expressed in terms of a performance radio ( PR): the actual yield of the plant ( how much energy it produces in a given time period) expressed as a percentage of its theoretical yield ( how much energy it could produce in that time period assuming the panels convert the incident light into energy at their nominal efficiency).', 'The theoretical yield of a plant can only be calculated using measurements of different components of solar irradiation. This means that these measurements are essential to calculate the performance ratio.', 'Performance ratio is a vital indicator for PV asset owners – but it’ s far from the only parameter of interest. Monitoring other weather parameters that directly impact solar cells is essential to obtain a complete picture of plant performance.', 'Photovoltaic efficiency is strongly dependent on temperature. As a rule of thumb, for every degree centigrade the temperature rises over 25 C, the efficiency of a typical PV module drops by around 0.5%. Measuring both the temperature of ambient air and the modules themselves enables the calculation of a temperature-corrected performance ratio, giving PV plant operators a more accurate picture of plant performance.', 'Wind can also have a dramatic effect on PV module temperature. Since PV surface temperatures are hotter than ambient air, wind cools them down, thus increasing their efficiency and output in warmer environments. Wind also has a significant effect on soiling, so knowledge of wind conditions can play an important role in soiling monitoring.', 'Since high wind speeds can damage PV installations, monitoring wind speed and direction is often important for determining safe locations for equipment – and can affect insurance payments.', 'Different kinds of precipitation can have a range of effects, both good and bad, on PV plants. For example, while heavy rainfall can dramatically reduce soiling by washing off dirt, light rainfall can actually increase panel soiling. Meanwhile, hailstorms can cause serious damage to panels and equipment.', 'Air pressure, humidity and dew point affect the occurrence of snow, frost, and condensation on panels which, as well as decreasing energy output, can have an effect on soiling. Air humidity, in particular, can also produce spectral changes which affect the productivity of PV modules.', 'Thanks to the number of parameters of interest and the sheer volume of different sensors on the market, assembling a meteorological station capable of providing complete and accurate information can be daunting.', 'Often, mixing-and-matching sensors from different vendors means contending with multiple data formats and software interfaces as well as having to grapple with complex mounting configurations and long cable runs.

The governor spoke at a U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources hearing last week. Earlier this year, President Biden signed executive orders to help fight climate change, which included pausing new oil and gas leases on federal lands and cutting fossil fuel subsidies.', '“ In my view, we’ ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis. ” —President Biden', 'A few weeks ago, The Huffington Post reported that there has been some behind-the-scenes lobbying. The Louisiana Mid-Continent Oil & Gas Association ( LMOGA) not only introduced top energy officials in Louisiana and New Mexico to one another, but it also provided the Louisiana official with industry talking points about how restricting oil and gas development would hurt Louisiana’ s economy. The organization helped ghostwrite a letter for Louisiana’ s governor to send to President Biden. The letter includes the argument that confronting climate effects depends on continued offshore fossil fuel development.', 'The article also noted that on the day before President Biden was expecting to sign his order, Lori LeBlank, vice president of LMOGA, emailed an Edwards staffer to request a meeting to “ discuss the federal executive orders around the leasing and drilling permit bans on federal lands and offshore. ” The article pointed out that LeBlanc falsely characterized the upcoming order as an all-out ban.', 'Last week, Governor Edwards went to Congress to share more of those talking points. The Louisiana Illuminator noted that Governor Edwards mentioned that 250,000 people in Louisiana are employed by the oil and gas industry. “ If this pause turns into something longer than the word ‘ pause’ suggests, we know that it will have a tremendously adverse impact on our state, ” said Governor Edwards.', 'Amanda Lefton, the director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, pointed out that the pause is limited to leasing and doesn’ t affect the production or permit applications for existing leases. “ There is continued production in the Gulf of Mexico and, therefore, there’ s continued revenue that’ s coming in, ” she said.', '“ The word ‘ pause’ by definition suggests there’ s going to be a resumption, ” said Governor Edwards. “ We want the resumption, and we want it as soon as possible so that the worst impacts don’ t happen. And that these people don’ t lose their chance at supporting themselves and their families. ”', 'I just want to quickly interject how deceptive this is here. The pause that he wants to be lifted doesn’ t have anything to do with existing leases — only new ones and on federal lands. In my opinion, Governor Edwards is simply being used as a mouthpiece for LMOGA — it’ s as if LMOGA is speaking at Congress through the governor.', 'Not all 250,000 employees are going to solely work on jobs related to new leases. The implication that the pause on the new leases will jeopardize 250,000 workers who will lose their jobs if President Biden doesn’ t lift that pause is very manipulative and deceptive. There is a possibility that some would lose jobs or hours might get cut back, but not all 250,000 of them will be fired if President Biden doesn’ t allow the oil industry free rein of the Gulf of Mexico.', 'The idea that the Biden administration’ s energy agenda is the reason behind job losses in the oil and gas industry is silly and pure FUD ( fear, uncertainty, and doubt). Lefton replied to this deceptive statement. “ There’ s a little bit more of a nuanced story here. We’ re actually seeing a decline of jobs in the oil and gas industry over the years, in the past four years in particular, ” she said. “ I think it’ s really important to think about what our opportunities are moving forward, and Gov. Edwards just spoke to one of those, which is how can we help transition communities to support new and growing industries like offshore wind. ”', 'Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney with the Center for Biological Diversity, emphasized the urgency to end offshore drilling. “ We don’ t have time to wait — the climate crisis demands immediate, bold action, ” she said. “ It’ s disappointing to hear the governor prop up offshore drilling while ignoring the immense damage it does in his apparent attempt to allow the oil industry to keep treating the Gulf as a sacrifice zone. ”', 'In November 2020, the LSU Center for Energy Studies released its annual report on the energy sector and The Advocate shared some key points from that study. Around 2,900 jobs in oil and natural gas production, oil refining, and chemical manufacturing are expected to be added back in Louisiana by the end of this year.', 'The article pointed out that Louisiana’ s energy sector growth is likely to be stifled even as the economy recovers from the recession that was triggered by the pandemic. Note that this article and study came out last year — well before President Biden’ s pause on oil and gas leases on federal lands.', '“ Corporations active in the energy industry, which includes oil and gas and petrochemicals, are under pressure by investors to curb or even eliminate major investments to preserve cash. Financing for aging fossil fuel infrastructure is more difficult to obtain while demand for oil and gas industry products remains much lower than before the public health crisis and related restrictions on the economy began about eight months ago.', '“ That means the jobs outlook for oil and gas production is bleak. Also, some multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas export terminals in Louisiana are less likely to be constructed because of contracted demand triggered by the global economic downturn. ”', 'In other words, the oil and gas industry is already struggling and will probably not hire people anyways. Additionally, it may cut jobs whether or not Biden lifts that pause. The article interviewed Dismukes, the executive director for the LSU Center for Energy Studies, who said, “ We were looking at a pretty weak environment as we moved into 2020. That had started before coronavirus began to kick in. ”', 'One example of this is that chemical manufacturers were expected to have surplus capacity through 2022 due to the curtailing of production, but were already below capacity before the pandemic even happened. Also, demand for domestic products from oil refineries has been lagging and utilization rates across the U.S. topped out at 70%.

Ongoing research has looked into biodegradability and ways to increase this. However, more recent research has focused on how plastic pollutants can damage biological organisms.', 'Image Credit: chayanuphol/Shutterstock.com', 'Microplastics are tiny pieces of plastic. Specifically, the size range given to microplastics is one micrometer to five millimeters in diameter. To give a sense of scale, one micrometer is a thousand times smaller than a millimeter.', 'Some primary microplastics are manufactured as microbeads for the cosmetic industry for uses within exfoliating hand creams and similar products. Microplastics also have mild abrasive properties, allowing them to be used within some cleaning products.', 'Another significant contributor to microplastic pollution is the textile industry. Microfibers used within products are released during manufacturing and wet processing stages, such as bleaching and dyeing. The laundering of microfiber textiles also contributes to microfiber release.', 'Secondary microplastics are usually formed when larger plastics undergo destructive processes, such as chemical, thermal, and photic exposure.', 'They have a very varied structure due to the number of products that can degrade into microplastics. For example, tires produce secondary microplastics as they wear against the road surface.', 'Some examples of polymers widely found within pollutant microplastics are polyethylene and polystyrene. These polymers have various uses, such as packaging or plastic bags; they are also widespread throughout the environment.', 'The effect of microplastic on all forms of life and ecosystems has been gathering interest within the scientific community.', 'Common additives, such as phthalate and some biphenyls, can have adverse biological effects, including possibly causing cancers or disrupting the endocrine system which is used to regulate hormone levels in the body.', 'Like other organisms, humans ingest microplastics in a variety of ways. Microplastics are present in the air, food, and drinking water, to name a few occurrences.', ""Scientists have tried to hypothesize microplastics ' effects and conducted some tests. Studies have found that smaller microplastics can pass through the lining of the gut, kidney and liver, and move into the bloodstream. This allows the plastics to then permeate throughout the body."", 'Plastics were also found in the brain of some fish species, but these plastics were among the smallest in diameter.', 'Scientists have suggested that human exposure could lead to DNA deformation and oxidative stress, including other potential health problems.', 'Microplastics are particularly prevalent in seawater. In 2022, a collection of studies found an average concentration of 1.75 MP/L with a variance of 5.17 MP/L between the recorded sites in the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. Wastewater had a lower concentration of 1.66 MP/L, only varying by 3.00 MP/L and showing that only some current treatment techniques remove microplastics.', 'While microplastic particles are harmful, their surface also contains high quantities of microorganisms, including some microbes identified as harmful pathogens to humans.', 'There are two main options for microplastic pollution treatment: removing microplastics or preventing further microplastic release into ecosystems and the atmosphere.', 'Removal from seawater and other aquatic ecosystems is currently the most feasible solution, with some technologies already in place. Efforts, such as the Ocean Cleanup from the Netherlands, have been limited, but some methods involving cargo ships have been proposed and tested prototypically.', 'Research conducted by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory found that feeding microplastics and algae to specific species of mussels can turn microplastics into feces pellets that float to the water surface and are easy to collect. Subsequent steps to collect these pellets are still required, reducing the effectiveness of this method in practicality.', 'Removing existing microplastics from aquatic settings alone requires an unrealistic amount of time, effort, and funding, with most of the latter coming from sponsorship or donations. This is because the systems do not return a sustainable financial gain during their research and development, leading to limited research within the scientific community.', 'Methods used in wastewater treatment plants have proved the most effective, even though the facilities were not originally designed to remove microplastics.', ""These plants ' chemical, physical and biological processes remove microplastics along the sewage sludge pulled from the water.

1284,Japan: Slow Restarts Cast Doubt on 2030 Energy Plan,2021-01-22,,"[""The slow pace of Japanese reactor restarts continues to cast doubt on the goal of the government's fifth Basic Energy Plan to lift nuclear's power share to 20% -22% by fiscal 2030, a target which the Tokyo-based Institute for Energy Economics Japan says will require the operation of at least 27 reactors. Nearly a decade after the Fukushima Daiichi triple meltdown, only nine of Japan's fleet of 51 remaining reactors have been restarted. Of these, only two were providing power to the grid at the start of the year, and by the end of the quarter another two should be joining them. Somewhat paradoxically this puts Kyushu Electric Power Co. in the lead as the country's only nuclear generator given that it is the owner-operator of the four aforementioned reactors -- Genkai-3 and -4 and Sendai-1 and -2. Tokyo Electric Power Co. ( Tepco) is struggling to bring one of two advanced boiling water reactors ( ABWRs) -- Kashiwazaki Kariwa-7 -- on line but must patiently await a lengthy prefectural approval process, and Kansai Electric Power Co., which supplanted rival Tepco as the country's lead nuclear generator in the aftermath of Fukushima is having its own set of struggles -- technical, legal and political -- with its four Ohi and Takahama units, all of which were restarted after the accident but are now at least temporarily shut down ( NIW Jan.15'21). A closer look at the Nuclear Regulation Authority's latest quarterly report Jan. 6 reveals a less than encouraging outlook for more than a dozen other reactors. The NRA has yet to approve applications to change reactor installations since confirming that Tepco's Kashiwazaki Kariwa-6 and -7 ABWRs, Japan Atomic Power Co.'s Tokai-2 BWR and Tohoku Electric's Onagawa-2 BWR conformed to post-Fukushima safety requirements in December 2017, September 2018 and February 2020, respectively. Of these, the only reactor which has received customary but essential consent from local authorities to move toward restart is the 825 MW Onagawa-2 but restart isn't expected until sometime in 2023 because the NRA has yet to approve either detailed construction work plans or the plant's security program ( NIW Nov.13'20). Tohoku is investing an estimated 350 billion yen ( $ 3.3 billion) in safety measures, including seismic retrofitting and the construction of an 800-meter long and 29-meter high seawall. JAPC received NRA approval for installation changes and a detailed construction plan at Tokai-2 in 2018 as well as for a 20-year operating license extension. The utility-owned company reportedly hopes to complete the safety upgrades by December 2022, but a spokesperson told Energy Intelligence that `` at this point, we are not at the stage to discuss the target date for restarting Tokai-2. '' The JAPC spokesperson said `` we must still complete 'pre-operational inspection ' in which the NRA will confirm that all work has been implemented properly in accordance with the construction plan approved by the NRA and we must also receive NRA authorization for its operational safety review. '' The spokesperson added that JAPC also has no schedule for receiving local government consents. In addition to the usual customary requirement for consents from the host prefecture ( Ibaraki) and town, Tokai Village, an agreement signed in March 2018 expanded the consent process to include five other localities in addition to Tokai Village within the 30-kilometer `` urgent protective action planning zone '' ( NIW Jun.12'20). Additionally, JAPC faces a critical judicial test Mar. 18 when the Mito District Court is expected to render its verdict on a petition filed by local residents in July 2012 for an injunction against the restart, according to the Tokyo-based National Network of Counsels in Cases against Nuclear Power Plants. Shikoku Electric's Ikata-3 PWR, idled since late December 2019, seems unlikely to restart before late 2021 at the earliest. A utility spokesperson told Energy Intelligence that one precondition will be a favorable verdict by the Hiroshima High Court, expected in March, on the utility's objection to a preliminary injunction issued by the same court last January ( NIW Jan.24'20). In addition, the utility must complete installation of `` specific severe incident countermeasures '' to cope with counterterrorism. The deadline imposed by the NRA for the completion of these upgrades is Mar. 22, but Shikoku doesn't anticipate completion until October.""]",energyintel,https://www.energyintel.com/0000017b-a7dc-de4c-a17b-e7de79160000

6758,Cambo: A year on from Shell decision not to invest,2023-01-12,,"['Its more than a year since Shell ( LON: SHEL) said it wouldn’ t invest in the Cambo oilfield, but as the project approaches a green light, the firm is weighing whether to stick or sell up its stake.', 'Cambo operator Ithaca Energy, which acquired the majority holding since then, wants to hit a key final investment decision ( FID) this year, but Shell launched a sales process for its 30% ownership back in August which could delay progress.', 'Shell has never left Cambo, and when asked last month whether it might stick with the oilfield – given tax incentives and improved commodity prices since the December 2021 decision, when the economics were questioned – North Sea boss Simon Roddy said “ we’ re still in the licence and still looking at options ”.', 'Right now, the Cambo partners are reviewing costs, with a drilling rig tender out ( with submissions due back January 17), so numbers there could play a role in decision-making.', 'But assuming Shell still wishes to divest, the environmental furore around Cambo, the costs of the project, and wider political uncertainty in the UK means the buyer pool is small, according to analysts.', '“ I struggle to see who would actually buy this, ” says Paul Weidman, head of oil and gas at consultancy Gneiss Energy.', '“ There are a number of large-ish developments out there already, ” he says, pointing to areas including Perth, Buchan and Galapagos, “ and stepping into the firing line of Cambo is probably not high on anyone’ s priority list, I wouldn’ t have thought. ”', 'Cambo, in the west of Shetland, is estimated to hold up to 800m barrels of oil in-place, with the first phase expected to recover 170m barrels.', 'In the run up to COP26 in November 2021, it was one of the most high-profile and environmentally contested oilfields in the world, making frequent national headlines.', 'Those concerns still need addressed, analysts agree, potentially through plans to electrify its production to cut emissions.', 'That aside, political uncertainty from Westminster, and a potential incoming Labour government, on the Energy Profits Levy ( EPL) – or windfall tax – could also be a barrier to a sale for Shell.', 'Yvonne Telford, senior analyst at Westwood Global Energy Group says: “ Recent fiscal instability has reduced the number of companies willing to make large scale investments in the UK and there is even greater uncertainty as to future governments and their support for future offshore developments.', '“ This could further reduce the prospective buyer pool. ”', 'She adds that Shell “ has not historically been fast paced in divesting its non-core assets and again this could impact the timing of the development ”.', 'Analyst firm Wood Mackenzie also notes the impact of the EPL on Cambo – as potential investors see that a future Labour government would likely slash the development incentives linked to it and raise the rate of tax further.', '“ Another partner will be required to help take the project through the development phase and the introduction – and subsequent increase – of the EPL has cast uncertainty over UK developments.', '“ While longer-lead time developments – such as Cambo – could see their returns boosted through an extension of the investment allowances, it would take a brave investor to assume the levy is removed six years from now. ”', 'But not everyone thinks Shell will struggle to sell.', 'Dave Moseley from consultancy Welligence, argues: “ If Shell still seeks an exit from Cambo, this should not be a barrier to development – several E & P companies have the appetite and funds to do a deal. ”', 'However, he also considers a scenario where Shell decides to stick with Cambo, rather than sell up.', 'Under the EPL, in its current guise, companies receive 91 pence back for every £1 spent on new UK developments.', 'To claim that, they need big capital projects, of which Cambo is one of just a handful in the UK available.', 'Moseley says: “ For Shell, when it announced in December 2021 that the case for investment in Cambo was not sufficiently robust, the EPL had yet to even be mooted.', '“ Now, with it having been introduced, and subsequently had both take and term increased, Shell will be eager to maximise its potential to offset this through large capex opportunities – of which Cambo is one of few.', '“ This is especially the case given projects like Penguins and Pierce depressurisation have largely had their full capex sunk, and therefore will not be effective in offsetting future EPL payments. ”', 'Weidman of Gneiss still sees the divestment as “ Plan A ” for Shell but sticking with it is also a valid Plan B, given Shell’ s commitment to the West of Shetland region.', 'The firm has holdings in the BP Schiehallion and Clair projects and recently bought into the Victory development too.', '“ Cambo fits into that narrative of West of Shetlands commitment, albeit it’ s clearly oil while Victory is gas.', '“ They have shown a continued commitment to the West of Shetlands, they have Victory from Corallian, they have Clair, they have Schiehallion. Shell are generally tidying up the UK with the southern gas basin sale, the ETAP sale, but they are really focused on the West of Shetlands ( as well as) Jackdaw, Shearwater and the Penguins redevelopment ( in the North Sea). ”', 'As Ithaca heads towards an FID with partners this year, environmental activism seems a certainty.', 'A month after COP26, Shell said it wouldn’ t invest in Cambo citing the potential for delays and that “ the economic case “ is not strong enough ”.', 'WATCH: We and @ StopCambo just challenged @ theSNP leader @ NicolaSturgeon on her refusal to stop the Cambo North Sea oil field.', 'Big corporations profit from dirty energy and politicians like Nicola Sturgeon let them get away with it.', 'We’ re here to put a stop to that. ✊ pic.twitter.com/Q3ilmhkA3C', '— Green New Deal Rising ( @ GNDRising) August 7, 2021', '', '🚨HUGE NEWS: @ NicolaSturgeon has now come out against the Cambo oil field # StopCambo🚨', 'This is a historic win and a huge testament to what we can accomplish.', ""Now let's take the fight to UK gov to reject Cambo once and for all ✖️🛢️ https: //t.co/qfceOJPK2x"", '— # StopRosebank ( @ StopCambo) November 16, 2021', '', 'Analysts agree the economic change may well be more attractive now due to the EPL and improved commodity prices, but Westwood, Wood Mac and Gneiss all agree the environmental activism has played a role in denting confidence.', 'Wood Mac summarises: “ Shell’ s decision to walk away went beyond project economics.', '“ Its involvement was garnering a huge amount of unwelcome attention and while energy security concerns have perhaps softened some attitudes towards new greenfield projects, environmental scrutiny isn’ t going way. ”', 'Gneiss meanwhile argues that, with Shell’ s North Sea projects gaining attention, Cambo might be too hot: “ They’ re already under pressure with Jackdaw, so adding another very high profile development to the docket is tough. So I guess they’ re probably weighing that. ”', 'It should be noted though that Shell concerns around delays are valid; Wood Mac points out that Cambo would be the first UK development in water depth over 1,000 metres “ with extreme conditions raising the likelihood of delays ”.', 'Analysts agree that Cambo is, one way or the other, likely or very likely to go ahead.', 'Ithaca seems ready to go “ guns blazing ” with the development, as it was a key driver in its $ 1.5bn takeover of operator Siccar Point Energy last year.', 'A key test will be in slashing emissions and Cambo is competitive on that front, despite the environmental outrage.', 'And it comes weeks after Ithaca, BP and Equinor signed an agreement to pursue electrification of oilfields, including Cambo, in the West of Shetland.', 'Wood Mac says: “ It’ s worth nothing that relatively speaking Cambo looks attractive from a carbon perspective. Its emissions will be less intensive than most countries the UK imports oil from and an electrification solution could help its emissions ( and optics) further.', '“ But UK electrification projects still face many challenges, including high investment costs, elevated power costs and relatively low carbon prices. ”']",energyvoice,https://www.energyvoice.com/oilandgas/north-sea/west-of-shetland/474463/cambo-a-year-on-shell-ithaca/
45907,US Federal Recommendations Support Monitoring for Offshore Wind,2021-12-26,,"['A new scientific publication provides recommendations on how to monitor ocean sounds and will help the offshore wind industry advance in a smart way that is protective of the marine environment.', 'Offshore wind energy development is now rapidly advancing in all regions of the United States. The rapid growth of this new clean energy industry is essential if we are to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, and the strides forward being taken by the Biden–Harris administration are to be celebrated.', 'At the same time, offshore wind must be sustainable for the marine environments it uses. The industry is a new one for the United States, and there are still many unanswered questions regarding the effects and potential impacts of development on habitats and species. Carrying out rigorous scientific monitoring studies before, during, and for several years after construction of offshore wind projects will help us understand the nature of any impacts that do occur, will allow us to adaptively manage projects, and will guide future development so that risks are continually reduced.', 'In October, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA) and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ( BOEM) took an important step in that direction, by jointly publishing minimum recommendations to guide these needed monitoring efforts. Their recommendations for how best to listen for marine wildlife — from the largest whales to economically important species like cod — should be used for monitoring and mitigation during offshore wind energy development.', 'We can learn a great deal about marine environments just by listening. Life in the ocean uses sound the same way humans use light to see. The ocean is comprised of underwater soundscapes, uniquely characterized by a region’ s species, seabed features, weather, and human uses. Listening to these soundscapes ( a method known as “ passive acoustics ”) can help us monitor for any changes in the marine ecosystem that may result from offshore wind energy development.', 'The new recommendations provide advice on how to choose among the many listening systems that can be used to monitor the marine environment during offshore wind development. Figure adapted from Van Parijs et al. ( 2021), Figure 1.', 'Networks of passive acoustic listening systems deployed over large areas can help us detect if species are using habitat differently in an offshore wind energy area following construction, and this information can help us determine if any observed changes are the result of development activities or some other factor. Listening systems can also help us identify time periods when vulnerable species are present in an offshore wind area in their highest numbers, which can be used to develop time-of-year noise restrictions on highly impactful activities like pile driving. Detections can also help protect species during construction and other noise-producing activities, by helping to flag the presence of animals in “ near real-time ” so that protective actions can be immediately taken, like delaying the start of pile driving until a vocalizing animal has left the area.', 'While using passive acoustic listening systems to monitor the marine environment during offshore wind development is incredibly valuable, it is not always clear which technology should be used for a particular monitoring goal, or how a network of systems should be deployed to effectively monitor for changes at a regional scale.', 'The new recommendations, published in Frontiers of Marine Science, a peer-reviewed scientific journal, answer these important questions. The publication offers a stepwise plan that advises the reader how to: ( i) understand the types of sounds produced by species that may be targeted for monitoring, ( ii) identify the most appropriate listening system for long-term monitoring versus near real-time applications, ( iii) develop a rigorous scientific study design, and ( iv) undertake analysis, archiving, reporting, and visualization of the acoustic data once it has been collected.', 'Recommended locations of passive acoustic listening stations for the New York Bight and Mid-Atlantic region around current wind development areas ( colored polygons). Adapted from Van Parijs et al. ( 2021). Supplementary Figure SI-3c', 'The authors also provide a map of recommended locations that passive acoustic listening systems be deployed off the entire East Coast, to conduct monitoring most effectively for offshore wind energy development. By using this map and adhering at the very least to the minimum recommendations, listening systems being deployed for individual projects can be positioned in a way that can contribute to a broader regional monitoring effort.', 'In fact, New York State recently announced nearly $ 1.3 million to support pre-development data collection in the New York Bight to facilitate responsible and cost-effective offshore wind energy development. One of the funding priorities is the establishment of a network of bottom-mounted passive acoustic monitors that will record marine mammal presence within wind energy areas. The map of recommended locations developed by NOAA and BOEM should be used to directly guide the design of this network.', 'Regional scale development of offshore wind energy requires a regional scale approach to monitoring. We applaud NOAA and BOEM for stepping up to the task of developing practical guidance for passive acoustic monitoring. We regard adherence to these recommendations as an essential element of any responsible offshore wind project, and look forward to seeing them actively used by scientists, NGOs, state agencies, and offshore wind developers. It would be very valuable if similar guidance were developed for visual monitoring, and we hope the federal agencies will play a similar leadership role on this topic in the future.', 'Originally published on the NRDC Expert Blog.', ""NRDC is the nation's most effective environmental action group, combining the grassroots power of 1.3 million members and online activists with the courtroom clout and expertise of more than 350 lawyers, scientists, and other professionals."", 'Advertise with CleanTechnica to get your company in front of millions of monthly readers.', 'El Niño conditions have developed, as the atmospheric response to the warmer-than-average tropical Pacific sea surface kicked in over the past month.

It is crucial to investigate sustainable methods for collecting and distributing fresh water among the general population to protect the worldwide water reserves."", 'There are various ways to increase water usage efficiency and productivity from traditional water resources such as surface water in lakes, rivers and reservoirs. These resources are insufficient to fulfill human demands. Therefore, some unconventional water resources to reduce the gap between water demand and supply must be investigated.', 'Fog is an overlooked source of fresh water. Harvesting of fog water requires a low maintenance system, low cost, and a passive way of attaining clean drinking water in areas with higher fog concentrations.', 'Fog water can supplement rainfall for tree planting in dry regions. It can be life-saving in dry, remote and semiarid areas with tropical or subtropical climates affected by huge shortages.', 'The mechanism of collecting fog water is straightforward. The wind pushes the fog through mesh exposed to the atmosphere. A portion of the fog droplets are deposited on the mesh material upon impact.', 'Fog droplets build up as they accumulate, combine, and convert into bigger droplets and finally flow into a storage tank through the gutters in the mesh material. Various fog collector designs are available with different mesh materials, dimensions, and shapes.', 'Standard Fog Collector ( SFC) assesses how much fog water can be collected at specific locations.', 'Schemenauer and Cereceda provided a detailed description of the creation and application of this flat mesh panel. The SFC is mounted perpendicular to the wind direction, is linked to the incidence of fog, and has a surface area of 1 m2 with a base elevation of 2 m.', ""Fog collection has traditionally been carried out using the Large Fog Collector ( LFC). It also works on the same principle as SFC but is considerably more significant in size. The mesh is typically 10 meters wide and 4 meters high. The mesh's lowest edge should be as high off the ground as feasible with the gutter attached ( usually 2 m), as it results in increased fog collection."", 'The mesh of the SFC design is stretched over a stiff frame. In the case of LFC, the mesh is supported by a cable framework firmly attached to two vertical poles.', 'Water accumulates on the mesh and drips downwards into drainage at the bottom of the net piped to a storage reservoir or tank. The typical daily water production rates from the typical fog collector vary from 300 to 1,000 liters, with daily and seasonal variations. Larger fog droplets, faster wind speeds, and narrower collecting fibers/mesh width all increase collection efficiency.', 'Video Credit: Leaf of life films/YouTube.com', 'Fog water can be used as a source of clean drinking water and as water for reforestation. It can also be used for domestic and agricultural purposes.', 'Atmospheric water is pure, free of harmful microbes, and appropriate for instant irrigation.', 'Water obtained using fog collecting equipment complies with World Health Organisation ( WHO) requirements.', ""The technology's installation and maintenance have a minimal environmental impact. Construction of fog harvesting technology is reasonably easy and can be carried out on-site once the parts and technical supervision have been acquired."", 'Simple skills are needed for the construction of the fog collector, and once the system is built, it does not require any energy to run. Since mountainous regions, where inhabitants frequently live in remote conditions, are particularly well-suited for fog harvesting, capital investment and other costs are typically minimal.', 'Fog harvesting systems rely on a water supply that is not always dependable because fogs can appear at any time. However, some regions do tend to generate more fog.', 'It can also be challenging to estimate the amount of water collected at a specific place. Unless a pilot project is first conducted to evaluate the possible water rate yield in the region under consideration, this technology poses an investment risk.', 'Deforestation has greatly influenced the natural fog cycle. Trees can be self-sufficient in an ecosystem because they can catch fog water that seeps down to their roots. Due to continuous deforestation, fewer trees are available to capture the fog water.', 'Deforestation is causing climate change and dry seasons all over the world. The loss of ground-covering plants due to changes in the natural hydrological cycle results in arid, heated landscapes more prone to erosion. Deforestation-related disruptions of the fog cycle can have long-lasting effects on surface water runoff and groundwater recharge.', 'Human involvement is required for these regions to recover as new plant growth is impossible without the extra water intake from fog drip typically provided by existing plants. Hydrological and ecological restoration of these regions is only possible with human involvement.', 'The newly planted trees will be able to survive the fog drop and become natural fog collectors. When fog drip returns to an area, it will help to restore the local ecosystem by recharging the groundwater and lowering the erosion rates.', 'Fog water in regions where fog is common can be used for reforestation and irrigation.', 'Klemm, O., Schemenauer, R.

17028,1st Solar Bike Path In Germany Is Now Live,2023-05-16,,"['This is one of those combos that always seems like a cleantech solution made in heaven: bike paths covered by simple solar PV roofs. Bikers, using the cleanest mode of transportation on Earth, get a little relief from the sun or protection from the rain while also being separated from the roadway and protected from drivers. As for the solar power, it’ s easy to install ( read: cheap), doesn’ t take away space from other uses, and gets to shine in public view.', 'Solar PV bike paths are not ubiquitous, though. In fact, they’ re rare. But Germany just got its first one, and maybe that’ s a sign of many more to come in the country. Also, recall that Germany has been a solar PV trendsetter in the past, largely kickstarting the rooftop solar PV revolution.', 'This solar PV bike path was installed by green energy company Badenova. It is in southern Germany, in the city of Freiburg, near SC Freiburg’ s football stadium. SC Freiburg’ s stadium is already covered in solar panels — heterojunction solar panels from Meyer Burger. ( SC Freiburg is currently sitting 5th in the Bundesliga, trying to edge its way into the top 4 for a place in the UEFA Champions League next year.)', 'The solar PV system totals 287 kW in capacity. It uses 900 Solarwatt translucent glass-glass solar modules. These solar modules are especially made and tested for applications such as this. “ The modules in the series have a general technical approval from the German Institute for Building Technology ( DIBt), ” pv magazine writes. “ They are therefore regarded as a regulated building product that can be used without restriction in the private and public sector. The solar modules can also be used for overhead and facade installations without individual checks and additional security measures. ”', 'Seemingly involved in most experimental solar PV tech in Germany, Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ( Fraunhofer ISE) was involved in this project. Fraunhofer is also the one leasing, monitoring, and operating the solar PV bike path', 'The mounting systems, meanwhile, came from a local Freiburg company, Clickcon.', 'Solar PV bike paths have always seemed so logical, with green uses complementing each other so well, that I’ m surprised they have not become big business yet. However, individuals and businesses have focused on putting solar panels on their roofs, where they can easily be connected to electricity, and companies building large projects as standalone money makers do them in open spaces. It is the ones owning, developing, or managing bike paths who would have to take the lead on initiatives like this. In the case of cities, counties, or other governmental entities, it appears that segment of society has not been keen to lead the way on this — “ playing it safe ” and going the rooftop or open-space route as well in the cases where they take any cleantech leadership role. Real estate developers also haven’ t been quick to roll these into new developments. Whatever the entity, it seems the PR and carbon-reduction potential of solar PV bike paths would pay off.

It includes proposals to make state aid more flexible, mobilize European funds, create a sovereign wealth fund, and improve European supply chains. The state aid revisions would apply until 2025, in comparison with the IRA’ s 10-year time frame.', 'The industrial plan will be based on four pillars: a predictable and simplified regulatory environment, better access to finance, upskilling, and open trade for resilient supply chains.', 'As part of the first pillar, the European Commission will propose an industry law to set targets for industrial capacity and provide an adequate regulatory framework for rapid deployment. It will guarantee faster, simplified permits, while also promoting strategic European projects. The framework will be complemented by the Critical Raw Materials Act and electricity market reforms.', 'The second pillar of the plan will accelerate investment and financing to produce clean technologies in Europe. The European Commission said public funding could unlock huge amounts of private funding. It wants to relax the rules on state aid that will be applied through the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework ( TCTF) for state aid. This will involve the expansion of provisions for net-zero technologies and storage, while eliminating the need for open tenders for less mature technologies and extending deadlines to complete projects.', ""The fourth pillar of the plan will focus on ” putting trade at the service of the ecological transition, ” under the principles of fair competition and open trade, based on commitments with European Union partners and the work of the World Trade Organization. To this end, the European Commission will further develop the European Union's network of free trade agreements and other forms of cooperation with partners to support the green transition. It will also explore the creation of a “ critical raw materials club ” to bring raw material consumers and resource-rich countries together, with the aim of ensuring global security of supply through a competitive, diversified industrial base."", 'The industrial plan is short on more details and does not discriminate between “ net-zero ” technologies in its policy proposals. This is something that SolarPower Europe has criticized.', '“ Industrial policy focus on critical renewable energy supply chains is a good thing. However, we’ re worried by the lack of focus in today’ s Communication, ” said Dries Acke, policy director at SolarPower Europe. “ Not all net-zero technologies are in the same boat – not in terms of strategic importance, or even the impact they’ re feeling from the Inflation Reduction Act. ”', 'Ursula von der Leyen said during the presentation of the plan that “ Europe is determined to lead the clean technology revolution. ” She added that better access to financing will allow key industries of clean technologies to “ grow rapidly. ”', 'Brussels has its sights set on the extraordinary Summit of EU Leaders on Feb. 9 and Feb. 10.

16184,On the Road to 100% Clean Electricity: 6 Potential Strategies To Break Through Last Few Percent,2022-09-19,,"['Study Surveys Trade-Offs of Technology Options To Overcome Challenging Last Few Percent to Zero-Emissions U.S. Power Grid', 'A growing body of research has demonstrated that cost-effective high-renewable power systems are possible, but costs increase as systems approach 100% carbon-free electricity—what has become known as the “ last 10% problem. ”', 'The increase in costs is largely driven by a seasonal mismatch between the timing of variable renewable energy generation and demand. Meeting peak demand is challenging and expensive for all power systems, but addressing the seasonal mismatch issue for high-renewable power systems may require technologies that have yet to be deployed at a large scale. That makes their costs and requirements unclear.', 'To help move toward potential solutions for this challenge, a team of National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL) researchers studied trade-offs of six possible technology strategies to get from 90% to 100% carbon-free electricity in the United States. This work, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy’ s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, is published in a Joule article and can help inform decision-making today.', '“ None of the strategies are perfect, and a lot of uncertainty remains, but the study highlights key challenges with the last 10% and examines all the major technology options, ” said Trieu Mai, NREL analyst and lead author of the study. “ More research and development will be important to move closer to a clear solution for the last 10% and progress the United States toward a decarbonized power sector. ”', 'NREL has been studying a variety of questions related to achieving 100% renewable generation in the United States.', 'In a previous Joule article, NREL outlined the techno-economic challenges of achieving 100% renewables across all timescales. The study explored two types of challenges: one related to economically maintaining a balance of supply and demand and another challenge related to designing technically reliable and stable grids using largely inverter-based resources like wind and solar.', 'In a follow-on study, NREL used state-of-the-art modeling capabilities to understand possible pathways and system costs of transitioning to a 100% renewable power grid. Results, published in another Joule article, show that costs are significantly lower if there is a cost-effective source of firm capacity—resources that can provide energy during periods of lower wind and solar generation, extremely high demand, and unplanned events like transmission line outages. Other resources besides wind, solar, and diurnal storage or load flexibility could be important for overcoming the last few percent to a 100% renewable power grid.', 'In the Los Angeles 100% Renewable Energy Study ( LA100), NREL used multiple models to examine which resources could be used to help meet the last 10% and maintain reliability for the city of Los Angeles. NREL also recently completed a landmark study on achieving 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. The analysis shows there are multiple pathways to achieve the goal in which the environmental and societal benefits exceed the costs.', 'This latest Joule article builds on the NREL high-renewable-generation power grid studies by exploring trade-offs of potential technical solutions that could be implemented for the last few percent.', 'The ideal technology solution for the last 10% has three primary characteristics. First, the ideal solution has high capacity credit so that capacity is available during high-stress periods and can support resource adequacy—one of the “ three Rs of power system reliability ” that must be successful for a safe and reliable power system. Second, the ideal solution has relatively low capital costs because it will not be used often. And third, it relies on broadly available resources and can be deployed at scale. NREL surveyed six technology strategies that have the potential to meet the three primary characteristics.', 'One possible strategy for achieving the last 10% relies on existing technologies that are currently being deployed. This strategy builds more variable renewable energy, transmission, and diurnal ( less than about 24-hour) storage. In this option, variable renewable energy and transmission capacity are sized to meet demand during daily stressful periods on the grid, with storage filling hourly supply gaps and curtailing excess variable renewable energy ( learn more about curtailment in an NREL explainer video).', 'This strategy could be more cost competitive if there is greater long-distance transmission to move high-value variable renewable energy to demand centers, and if wind and solar technologies continue to improve. However, this approach could be more difficult if wind and solar land use and site constraints increase over time—another topic NREL has been studying, including the recent release of a new comprehensive data set of local ordinances for siting wind and solar energy projects.', 'Another possible strategy for the last 10% uses geothermal, hydropower, and biomass—technologies that could all play important roles in a zero-emissions power sector. These technologies do not rely on variable solar and wind resources and can potentially overcome the seasonal mismatch. However, resource availability, especially at locations with high electricity demand, might narrow their utilization to select regions only. These resources also have relatively high capital costs that might be economically challenging as a last 10% strategy.', 'Biomass-based generation could be another option to produce renewable electricity for the last 10%. This option has relatively low capital cost, but there are uncertainties and constraints on a steady and sustainable feedstock supply and the cost of biomass conversion.', 'Nuclear and fossil fuel with carbon capture and storage ( CCS) are widely cited as potentially important resources in a decarbonized electricity system because they are often reliably counted on throughout the year. Fossil CCS plants have not yet been deployed at scale, but some studies find significant deployment potential.', 'However, this strategy comes with challenges: limited recent deployment, cost uncertainties, and environmental and security considerations—and the high capital cost for low utilization could create economic barriers.', 'Seasonal storage refers to using electricity to produce a storable fuel that can be used for generation over extended periods of time, even up to entire seasons of the year. Hydrogen or other hydrogen-derived fuels are currently the most promising options for seasonal storage. Converting hydrogen to electricity can be done using fuel cells or combustion technologies, which are being converted for hydrogen. These electricity generation options fueled by hydrogen could have low capital costs in the future and be viable as last 10% strategies. Key uncertainties with this strategy include the availability of the fuel ( hydrogen) supply and delivery infrastructure.', 'Carbon dioxide removal technologies can offset emissions from carbon-emitting power generation technologies by drawing down atmospheric carbon. This last 10% strategy is unique because it leverages other generation assets to support resource adequacy on the grid.', 'While there is unique value with carbon dioxide removal technologies, this last 10% option has deployment challenges. Very little carbon dioxide removal has been deployed yet worldwide, and future technology costs remain uncertain.', 'Demand-side resources, also called demand response or demand flexibility, are a unique last 10% solution compared to the other five strategies studied.', 'Demand-side resources reduce electricity consumption during times of system stress and help avoid investments in new peaking capacity. Through flexible scheduling or interruption of electricity consumption, they can also reduce operating costs or be used for important grid-reliability services. Capital costs for demand-side controls and communications equipment can be low, and direct operating costs are modest.', 'However, applying demand-side options as a last 10% strategy requires the resources to be reliably available over extended multiday periods. The scale of response needed on days of extreme events could exceed the demand-response potential, and flexibility from new electrified loads is uncertain.', '“ Given current technology costs and readiness, significant emissions reductions can occur through accelerated deployment of wind, solar, diurnal storage, transmission, and other renewable energy technologies, ” said Paul Denholm, NREL analyst and co-author of the study. “ Other technologies could also play a big role if they become cost competitive and widely available. We will continue to study these possible solutions, but for now, the pathway to about 90% carbon-free electricity is increasingly clear. After all, getting to 100% requires first achieving 90%. ”', 'Learn more about NREL’ s energy analysis and grid modernization research.

78072,'Long-duration energy storage can be deployed faster and more cheaply than green hydrogen ',2022-10-27,,"['As governments around the world grapple with the urgent conundrum of how simultaneously to make their supplies more secure, greener and cheaper, energy storage stalwart Alan Greenshields is worried that what he terms the “ missing piece ” of the puzzle isn’ t drowned out by the buzz around other transition technologies – wind, solar, lithium-ion batteries, and loudest of all, hydrogen.', 'The weapon in the energy transition arsenal Greenshields is referring to is long-duration energy storage ( LDES), a suite of technologies set to fill a crucial role in an increasingly complex, renewables-led power system ( see panel) sitting between shorter-duration lithium-ion systems and massive deployments based around hydrogen or hydropower.', '“ Renewables have become the cheapest form of generation. Lithium-ion has done a fantastic job for mostly regulation functions in the grid, but we need cheap, bulk storage – that’ s the missing piece. ”', 'Greenshields – a long-time veteran of the energy storage sector and other high-tech industries, who is now director of Europe at US-based iron-flow battery pioneer ESS – claims the fact that “ hydrogen for a long time was basically cited as a solution to everything ” created a shortfall in policy awareness and action over the potential of LDES that has only recently started to be addressed.', 'For example, the “ EU has a lot of programmes for supporting new technologies – vast amounts of it have gone into hydrogen, almost nothing has gone into LDES ”.', 'He adds: “ The belief that hydrogen was the universal solution led for a significant period of time to LDES not being really taken seriously. ”', 'Greenshields – who took part on a panel on the future of storage at Recharge’ s recent Energy Transition Forum – says making the right choices from now on is crucial, because you don’ t have to look too hard to see the cost of unintended policy consequences in the current global energy landscape.', 'Analysts at McKinsey in a report on LDES defined it as “ a group of conventional and novel technologies, including mechanical, thermal, electrochemical, and chemical storage, that can be deployed competitively to store energy for prolonged periods and scaled up economically to sustain electricity provision, for days or even weeks ”.', 'Sitting between lithium-ion batteries and huge options such as hydro, the McKinsey report – commissioned by the industry’ s own body the LDES Council – reckons it will play a crucial role in a sector that will need to scale up to between 85-140TWh by 2040 to hit decarbonisation goals.', 'McKinsey said LDES’ attributes of rapid deployability and scalability “ makes it competitive with other forms of energy storage such as lithium-ion batteries, dispatchable-hydrogen assets, and pumped-storage hydropower, and economically preferable to expensive and protracted grid upgrades.', '“ Indeed, the evidence shows that in many applications, it is likely to be the most cost-competitive solution for energy storage beyond a duration of six to eight hours. ”', 'Take Germany, whose Energiewende has been impressive on many fronts, but which Greenshields says has been left “ laggards in energy storage because of policy ” after in 2014 conducting an analysis concluding that “ LDES was too expensive. “ Which in 2014 was correct. But in 2014 you had the iphone 5, lithium-ion batteries were very expensive, solar was very expensive ”, and LDES is, albeit later, following those examples down the cost-reduction path.', 'In fact, the country did not until recently have a legal definition at all of what constituted energy storage on the German power grid, leaving battery storage lumped in as a generation asset.', 'The German approach, says Greenshields, was to go “ very fast into feed-in tariffs for solar, for wind, phase out coal, phase out nuclear and replace it with natural gas – and basically walked right into a trap laid by Vladimir Putin ”.', 'Now Germany is racing to end that dependency on gas and replace it “ with cheap, plentiful green hydrogen, when it’ s available ”.', 'Like others, Greenshields notes the dilemma for European economies such as Germany that the cheapest places to make green H2 are far away, and while “ it may well be possible to get green H2 [ production ] down to less than $ 2 per kg, the bigger challenge is how do you get the transportation costs down from $ 5/kg to maybe $ 1 ”.', 'The bottom line, in Greenshields view, is that while hydrogen will have a major role to play in the energy transition – not least for decarbonising heavy industry and helping energy systems cope with multi-week periods of low wind and solar output – “ there’ s still not really high awareness that long duration storage can be deployed much faster and more cheaply than green hydrogen ”.', 'So, is Germany now looking more seriously at LDES? Greenshields says the new coalition government has finally added a policy ‘ bucket’ for storage, although “ they haven’ t defined what that means ”.', 'Everyone says we’ d like LDES – the question is how do you establish a monetisation system.', 'If Germany is playing catch-up, when asked which governments around the world are best getting to grips with the policy challenges of LDES, the energy storage executive admits that the field is a slim one.', 'The UK is singled out by Greenshields as “ a good example of a government trying to work out the right way to do it… they have actually reached out to industry players asking what we need to do ” and has produced a study via the Department of Business Energy and Industrial strategy that he recommends as one of the best recent overviews of options for the sector.', 'Encouragingly, the UK is looking at the possible use in LDES of tools such as contracts-for-difference that have proved successful in stimulating other energy technologies.', 'Greenshields says enthusiasm around the world for LDES is growing, with jurisdictions from Australia to California looking at how to make the technologies part of their ambitious energy storage plans.', '“ Everyone says we’ d like LDES – the question is how do you [ establish ] a monetisation system. ”', 'Key, according to Greenshields, is getting LDES to scale and making it profitable on a non-subsidy basis.', '“ What we want is to get to the situation where the business models are such that it sucks in private capital. ”', 'And if policymaking over LDES is immature, the industry veteran is encouraged by moves by “ forward-thinking ” corporations such as RWE. “ We need them to be our champions, ” he says.', 'He also flags the benefits of an alliance between the EU and Breakthrough Energy Ventures – the Bill Gates-supported energy investor that has backed ESS – in looking to help mobilise the scale-up of LDES.', '“ Hydrogen grabbed everyone’ s attention [ but ] just as the prices of solar and wind and lithium-ion have plummeted, the cost of LDES has also now plummeted – it’ s just happened later.', '“ There’ s an awareness issue that things that were too expensive in 2014 are absolutely now competitive. It’ s not rocket science, it’ s the same sort of volume driven, technology driven improvement curves these other technologies have been through, ” Greenshields concludes.', 'Global energy storage markets will together grow 15-fold to 411GW ( 1.19TWh) by the end of the decade boosted by recent policy shifts in the US and Europe, although supply chain constraints might slow additions, according to the latest forecast from BloombergNEF ( BNEF).', 'The research house sees 13% more capacity – 46GW ( 145GWh) – than previously estimated being built, given extra drive by the US Inflation Reduction Act ( IRA), which has earmarked $ 369bn for clean technologies, and the EU’ s REPowerEU plan, which has raised ambitions to cut reliance on gas from Russia.', 'BNEF’ s 2H 2022 Energy Storage Market Outlook estimates roughly 30GW ( 111GWh) of energy storage will be built through to 2030, although supply chain bottlenecks “ cloud deployment expectations until 2024 ”.', 'In the utility-scale sector, significant storage additions expected from 2025 onwards align with raised renewable targets outlined in the REPowerEU plan and a renewed focus on energy security in the UK, according to BNEF, which has more than doubled its estimates for deployments in the second half of this decade across Europe.', 'Recharge is part of DN Media Group.

27630,The Sustainable Choice: Electric Bike on a Budget,2022-05-23,,"['Though you can say that the world has developed so much that technology can be seen everywhere you go, and life has been relatively easy and efficient. Sadly, this caused detrimental effects on the planet. Each year the global temperature rises because of greenhouse gases that cause climate change—one of the biggest threats to the world in this 21st century.', 'Environmentalists are pleading for the world to contribute to saving the planet through living sustainably. And this can be done by lowering one’ s carbon footprint. Today, calls for sustainable traveling, transportation, eating, cooking, and fashion are louder, and many companies are heeding the call. This includes the use of electric bikes ( e-bikes) as a mode of transportation.', 'E-bikes are an affordable solution to the growing problem of high energy-consuming transportation. They’ re a great environment-friendly option for those who want to participate in the global movement to reduce carbon footprint. They are sustainable and more energy-efficient compared to other modes of transportation. Additionally, one of the best things about them is they’ re affordable, and you can easily find an electric bike on a budget. If you want to learn more, discover here.', 'The first e-bikes were developed in the late 19th century, but it was only in 1997 that the first commercial e-bike was created. Two prominent Japanese companies were the first to mass-produce e-bikes in the early 2000s, and since then, their popularity has become huge. It has become the preference of many. Some countries even encourage their citizens to use e-bikes for their daily commute to lessen the traffic and help ease the air pollution.', 'The carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases generated by your actions. The United States has the most extensive carbon footprint globally at 16 tons per person per year, with the global average at only 4 tons/person/year. Greenhouse gases affect the environment and cause toxic acid rain, coastal acidification, glaciers, and polar ice melting.', 'E-bikes use rechargeable batteries to run instead of fuel. It is low cost, energy-efficient, and emission-free. It runs at a 250-watt motor that will give you a speed of up to 20mph on a single charge. The total carbon footprint of an e-bike is only 14g/km compared to a car which is at 150g/km, and public transportation at 60-80g/km. The use of low-cost rechargeable batteries is one of the reasons why e-bikes are not a substantial investment.', 'The precarious situation our planet is facing today demands everyone to contribute and give their share in helping the planet heal. Otherwise, we will be facing dire consequences that could be detrimental to us. E-bikes are one of the solutions we can utilize. This mode of transportation is not even expensive, yet very efficient. And there are many benefits to using an electric bike on a budget. Here are a few of them:', 'Many manufacturers of e-bikes started with the mission of helping the environment. That is why most of them live through their promise and incorporate environmentally friendly ways of manufacturing their product. Many manufacturers use recycled materials in building e-bikes, such as long fiber thermoplastic ( LFT) compounds.', 'The manufacturers of e-bikes also try their best to use energy-saving and energy-efficient measures in making their products. And even the last step of packaging, e-bikes use recycled materials.', 'E-bikes don’ t use fuel to run. They only rely on the electricity from the battery and human pedaling. They have zero emissions and don’ t add to the greenhouse gases in the environment. By using e-bikes for traveling, you’ re cutting back on car use and don’ t add to the air pollution and traffic, thus, reducing your carbon footprint.', 'Most electric bikes on a budget use lithium-ion batteries, which is the standard for rechargeable batteries. Since it’ s rechargeable, you don’ t have to dispose of the batteries every time it’ s unusable, and one of the best things about this is that even the battery is recyclable.', 'The world commonly uses lead-acid batteries, the big bulky ones that often leak toxic acid if improperly disposed of. It’ s about time this is eradicated, and lithium-ion batteries are the best alternative. Many companies that encourage their employees to use e-bikes to get to work provide a sustainable charging station for their employees. This charging station often runs on solar energy. The best thing with this battery is they only need 2-3 hours to charge.', 'The elderly will have the best time going around on an e-bike. They can stay active without exerting too much physical effort and can ride safely on bike lanes provided by the city. So instead of being taken to places they want to go by car, they can be encouraged to see the world outside, go to parks, and see their friends safely and comfortably.', 'Everyone has a responsibility to the planet. Whether simply eating your favorite steak or setting your hair with hairspray, each of your actions affects the earth negatively.

Extreme drought adds to other risks such as wildfires that can put transmission lines at risk, ” Nannini added.', 'NV noted in its request to the PUCN that nearly 26 GW of coal- and natural gas-fired resources are set to be retired from the Western Interconnection portfolio by 2032. The utility said not only could the retirements negatively impact the region’ s resource mix, but could delay planned renewable resource additions in the West.', 'Nannini told NGI that in the short term, adding the peaking capacity would “ provide reliable, uninterrupted service when demand is high in the hot summer months. ” There also is the potential for the plant to use a blend of hydrogen in future operations.', '“ In the long term, the Silverhawk generating units were designed to run on hydrogen in anticipation of meeting our net zero commitments, complementing our expansion of noncarbon resources, ” Nannini said.', 'In regulatory documents, NV said the combustion turbines would be capable of operating on a 15% hydrogen mixture with the original equipment manufacturer, and eventually operate on 100% hydrogen.', 'Additionally, NV has committed to reaching an energy portfolio including a 50% mix of renewable sources by 2030.

They said that PV systems could become cheaper by up to 50% by 2035.', 'Based on its analysis of data on electricity pricing in the United Kingdom from 2010-21, the group said that large-scale PV systems were already less expensive than wholesale electricity in 2021. Prices stood at GBP 51/MWh, while the cost for smaller systems was estimated at GBP 149/MWh.', ""The researchers projected the LCOE for various PV system sizes until 2035, considering different variables.

The researchers forecast that the capacity will increase to around 21 GW in 2025 and approximately 29 GW in 2030. Considering the projected efficiency improvements and cost reductions, the study suggests that the UK government should support developers and investors, particularly in the early stages, by facilitating land purchases for PV farms and offering preferential loans with low interest rates to expedite PV system development.', 'More support would speed up adoption of the technology, leading the country to transition more quickly to a carbon-free future, said the researchers.

45926,Empire State Goes Ga-Ga Over Offshore Wind Energy,2022-01-07,,"['Another sign that coal is toast: New York State stakes another $ 500 million to beat its East Coast rivals to the offshore wind energy punch.', 'In the race to harvest offshore wind energy along the Atlantic coast, New York is not messing around. The Empire State has just launched a new $ 500 million investment program aimed at sealing the title of Offshore Queen, as announced by Governor Kathy Hochul during her State of the State address this week. New York better watch out, though. Little old New Jersey is already nipping at its heels.', 'The new $ 500 million wind program will accelerate New York’ s already impressive offshore wind energy portfolio. To date, the state claims 5 offshore projects and 5 ports under development, and has procured a total of 4,300 megawatts worth of offshore wind energy towards a goal of 9,000.', '“ New York’ s current offshore wind project portfolio represents the largest suite of offshore wind projects under active development in the nation, ” explains NYSERDA, the New York State Energy Research and Development Agency.', 'That is so, and they are not letting the grass grow under their feet. Governor Hochul’ s big wind energy announcement will muscle up the state’ s ports, manufacturing, and supply infrastructure, creating more than 2,000 new green jobs along with the new clean kilowatts.', 'The $ 500 million is just for starters. Hochul expects to leverage private capital to add more than $ 2 billion to the state’ s economy. As she explains, the aim is to ensure that “ New York has the strongest offshore wind energy market along the Eastern Seaboard, enabling us to be the offshore wind supply chain hub for other projects up and down the coast. ”', 'Governor Hochul also announced that NYSERDA is launching its next offshore wind energy procurement program this year. They anticipate at least 2 gigawatts in new projects coming into the the pipeline.', 'According to NYSERDA, the 2 gigawatts would bring the state’ s total offshore wind to the equivalent of 4.5 million homes, so the next hurdle is getting offshore wind energy over to where people can use it. They have that covered, too.', '“ To realize an offshore wind grid able to deliver at least 6 gigawatts of offshore wind energy directly into New York City while minimizing onshore and ocean floor impacts, state agencies will conduct a New York State Cable Corridor Study to identify strategic offshore wind cable corridors and access key points of interconnection to the grid, ” Hochul announced.', 'Apparently you ain’ t seen nothing yet. All of this activity is taking place in relatively shallow waters, where conventional monopile wind turbine construction is the norm. Hochul also let slip that NYSERDA is already working on a new offshore wind master plan that will tap deeper waters farther offshore, which means that floating wind turbines will be in the mix.', 'The new financial firepower builds on an advantage gained by New York, after rival state New Jersey let an Obama-era wind energy grant slip through its fingers.', 'New Jersey had a shot at becoming the very first East Coast state with an offshore wind farm, thanks in part to a 2014 US Department of Energy grant aimed at spurring innovation in the offshore industry. The total funding pot was $ 141 million spread among three projects, one of which was the proposed 6-turbine Fishermen’ s Energy demonstration wind farm off the coast of New Jersey.', 'Unfortunately for wind fans, the administration of former Governor Chris Christie was apparently not a willing partner. Uncertainty over the future of the state’ s wind industry abounded during his tenure, partly because its Public Service Commission was slow to form an appropriate regulatory structure for wind energy. Fishermen’ s Energy encountered one obstacle after another and the Energy Department finally had to claw back the company’ s $ 47 million share of the innovation grant in 2017.', 'So, despite its generous helping of federal offshore wind lease areas ripe for the picking all along its coastline, New Jersey sat on the sidelines while New York raced ahead, that is, until Governor Christie left office.', 'Since then, New Jersey has shaken itself out of the doldrums. The state is already threatening New York’ s plans to dominate the Atlantic Coast for monopile wind turbine manufacturing, and offshore lease activity has picked up considerably.', 'One prize that New Jersey missed out on was a national wind energy R & D consortium established by the Energy Department in 2017. New York State was a front runner in the competition to lead the program, and NYSERDA won the $ 18.5 million funding prize in 2018.', 'Now it looks like everyone is going to be in one big happy family. Earlier this week, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities announced that it has joined the National Offshore Wind Research and Development Consortium, which it describes as a “ prominent U.S. offshore wind research organization. ”', '“ Established in 2018, NOWRDC is national not-for-profit public-private partnership focused on advancing offshore wind technology in the U.S. through high impact research projects and cost-effective responsible development, while maximizing other economic and social benefits, ” NJBPU adds.', 'NJBPU President Joseph L. Fiordaliso, who was appointed to his post by current New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, could hardly contain his enthusiasm.', '“ We are excited to be joining NOWRDC as the representative for the State of New Jersey, ” he said. “ Our participation in this prominent national organization will aid our offshore wind efforts and play a key role in helping us meet Governor Murphy’ s goal of 7,500 MW of offshore wind energy by 2035. ”', '“ New Jersey’ s membership in NOWRDC allows the state to participate in regional research and monitoring activities as recommended by the New Jersey Offshore Wind Strategic Plan and to further the research into offshore wind activities with a goal of lowering the cost of Offshore Wind, ” NJBPU added, further adding that the membership “ provides New Jersey a platform to collaborate with other states in coordinating regional monitoring and scientific and technical research at the state and regional levels to address issues related to offshore wind energy project planning, siting, construction, and operation.', 'They’ re going to need all the help they can get. Coastal and fishing industry stakeholders in New Jersey have already geared up for a fight over the new lease areas, so stay tuned for more on that.', 'Meanwhile, it’ s worth noting that President Joe Biden’ s Build Back Better climate action bill would help push things along even faster, if only West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin would stop fiddling around and start supporting the 50-strong Democratic caucus in the Senate. With his vote and Vice President Kamala Harris as tie-breaker, Build Back Better is a shoe-in.', 'Senator Manchin has been holding onto his vote, for reasons best known only to himself. It could be a case of sour grapes, considering that landlocked West Virginia will not share in the offshore wind gold rush. Still, there are plenty of opportunities to grow new green jobs in the Mountain State, and Build Back Better would assist families with child care and other expenses related to employment.', 'Manchin’ s Republican colleague, West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito, could push Build Back Better over the finish line by voting with the Democratic caucus, but she and all 49 other Republican senators are holding back, too. In that context it may be somewhat unfair to blame Senator Manchin for singlehandedly killing his own party’ s signature legislation, but them’ s the breaks.', 'Image ( cropped): Offshore wind energy sites for New York State, courtesy of NYSERDA.', 'Tina specializes in military and corporate sustainability, advanced technology, emerging materials, biofuels, and water and wastewater issues.

Furthermore, it provided an assessment of their durability, with a particular focus on their vulnerability to abrasion.', 'Moreover, they discussed the incorporation of properties such as anti-soiling and sub-bandgap reflection into existing AR coatings.', 'As for the single-layer AC coatings, the scientists said that the sum of their reflectance and transmittance values at each wavelength should be 100%, noting that this technology is currently the industry standard.', '“ Because single layers minimize reflection at a single wavelength, reflectance rises to either side of this, making single layer AR coatings less effective over longer wavelength ranges, ” they said, however, stressing their current limits. “ Also, the need for a low refractive index material means that porous materials are generally used, and this can lead to durability issues. ”', 'Multilayer anti-reflection ( MAR) coatings, by contrast, are presented as able to overcome the typical limitations of single-layer coatings, as they have a high and low refractive index, which reduces reflection across a broader wavelength range.', '“ The most basic type of MAR coating is a double layer coating consisting of one high index and one low index material, both a quarter-wave thick, ” they explained, adding that MAR coatings also offer an advantage in terms of durability, as they have no need for ultra-low refractive index materials. They also stressed, however, that these coatings are generally more expensive, which limits their adoption at a commercial level.', ""When it comes to durability, the scientists said they found that the coatings ' useful lifetimes are under 8 years, although manufacturers usually offer a 25-year warranty for their PV modules."", '“ Because the AR coating is hydrophilic, with a water contact angle of around 20 degrees, increased soiling has been observed in some locations, causing a power loss greater than the improvement obtained from the addition of the AR coating, ” they emphasized. “ This emphasises the need for the addition of hydrophobic, anti-soiling functionality for AR coatings on PV module especially for locations with levels of high soiling. ”', ""Looking forward, the team said that the research should focus on improving AR coatings ' durability and multifunctionality, with special attention for anti-soiling techniques. “ Further work is required to improve the UV resistance of currently available commercial hydrophobic coatings, and this should be a focus for industry, ” it concluded."", 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

78571,Indonesia provides technical guidance to encourage geothermal direct use,2022-11-24,,"['The Directorate of Geothermal in Indonesia recently conducted a Technical Guidance session to encourage geothermal direct use applications.', 'The Directorate of Geothermal of Indonesia under the Directorate General of New, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation ( EBTKE) recently conducted a Technical Guidance ( Bimbingan Teknis) session for business permits related to geothermal direct use applications. This aims to encourage geothermal direct use and support the country’ s energy transition goals. Director for Geothermal Harris Yahya said that the geothermal potential in Indonesia can be as high as 23.36 GW. A majority of this will be used indirectly for power generation. With a relatively smaller capacity for direct use, the resources must be managed and optimized properly for maximum utilization. The use of heat from surface geothermal manifestations, from hot water or steam from drilled wells, or from downstream heat of power generation facilities are all considered examples of geothermal direct use. Harris explained that Law No. 21 of 2014 governs the use of geothermal energy, both for direct and indirect utilization. More specifically for direct use, Law No. 11 of 2020 is the legal basis for Job Creation and Government Regulation No. 5 of 2021 is the basis for the Implementation of Risk-Based Business Permits. Moreover, the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources ( MEMR) Regulation No. 5 of 2021 defines the Geothermal Exploitation Business Licensing Standards.

This partnership will make it easier for businesses, including nonprofits, to understand their options for financing a solar system, and to apply for a solar loan without friction by leveraging the best-in-class platforms offered by both EnergySage and Sunstone.', 'As inflation and utility rates continue to rise, and as investors, lenders and customers increasingly demand sustainable solutions, businesses across the country are exploring solar as a way to save money and reduce their carbon footprint. For nearly a decade, EnergySage has been helping people make smarter energy decisions through education, simplicity, transparency and choice. Now, through the partnership with Sunstone, any business or property owner that registers with EnergySage to comparison-shop custom quotes for a solar energy system will have access to financing via Sunstone’ s suite of low-rate, long-term loan solutions.', '“ Historically, getting a loan for a solar energy system has been a major barrier for most businesses and nonprofits, ” said Charlie Hadlow, VP of marketplace growth at EnergySage. “ Small and medium-sized businesses have been overlooked and underserved for too long by our industry despite their enormous impact on the economy, their potential to help combat climate-change, and the many benefits of switching to solar as a business. By teaming up with Sunstone, EnergySage is able to quote any business interested in going solar through our marketplace, a financing solution that’ ll cover 100% of the cost. It’ s a real game-changer for a relatively untapped segment of the market. ”', 'The market size for commercial solar in the U.S. is estimated at over $ 1 trillion, but so far has only seen 2% penetration. This is due in large part to limited access to solar ownership, which is often the most economical option for business owners since it allows them to take full advantage of the available tax incentives and energy savings. Without the availability of loans for solar, businesses would need to pay cash for their system or navigate the considerable complexities of government-sponsored lending programs and third-party-owned arrangements. Sunstone’ s borrower-friendly loan financing solutions will enable more businesses to reap all the benefits of solar ownership including utility and tax bill savings, energy independence and environmental sustainability.', ""Kelsey is managing editor of Solar Power World and host of the Contractor's Corner podcast."", 'Copyright © 2023 WTWH Media, LLC.

79010,Flexible heat pumps ideal for power grids congested by solar and wind – pv magazine International,2021-01-29,,"['Dutch transmission system operator Tennet, which also serves Germany, is planning to create flexible electricity demand and reduce grid congestion by promoting the use of smarter heating systems and heat pumps that can also be powered by solar and wind energy. According to its experts, intelligent control of heat pumps may result in the creation of between 0.5 and 1 GW of temporary grid flexibility by 2030.', 'The use of heat pumps and more flexible heating systems coupled to wind and power generation may be particularly beneficial for countries with serious grid congestion issues like the Netherlands.', 'This is the main conclusion of a recent report published by Dutch electricity transmission system operator ( TSO) Tennet, in which its experts analyzed how the use of heat pumps and smarter heat networks may contribute to the creation of more flexible electricity demand, which would, in turn, have the twofold advantage of reducing fossil fuel consumption and not wasting surplus renewable energy generation during peak hours.', 'The Dutch high-voltage grid operator said that in hours with poor renewable energy production, part of the heating systems could be idled temporarily, and in hours with a lot of electricity from the sun and wind, the heat systems could be powered by these two sources to provide extra heating. “ In 2030, this concept could already provide between 0.5 and 1 GW of temporary flexibility and, in order to achieve this, the heat pumps must be intelligently controlled, ” Tennet explained.', 'The flexible demand created by this approach would help to level off peak loads during strong generation of wind and solar if the capacity of the electricity grid is in danger of being exceeded. “ This flexibility is needed to make maximum use of variable solar and wind generation in hours of abundance, and to reduce electricity demand in hours without solar and wind electricity, ” the authors of the report affirmed.', 'Flexible heat pumps would be key in this scenario as they can switch back temporarily, while a well-insulated building can remain sufficiently heated for a certain time. Furthermore, hybrid heat pumps that can be powered by both gas and renewables would also represent an optimal solution, as they can temporarily rely on the fuel in the event of electricity shortages. “ This reduces the peak demand for electricity and keeps homes warm, ” the report notes, adding that on days with abundant solar and wind power production, heating systems with heat storage may also save some sustainable heat to power the building the following day.', ""According to Tennet experts, this flexible electricity demand for heat would not only contribute to CO2 reduction by using the electricity as much as possible in hours with abundant wind and sun but also by utilizing it as little as possible in the hours with largely gas-fired electricity. “ This helps to keep consumers ' energy bills from being higher than necessary in the future, ” they further explained. “ This advantage can be achieved through a contract with flexible prices with the supplier or a discount when flexibility is made available. ”"", 'The report states that these benefits will be negligible in the near future, although they may become bigger by 2030 and will continue to grow when more and more electricity from solar and wind is produced.', 'Tennet and Viessmann, a German manufacturer of heating, industrial and refrigeration systems, are currently working on a joint pilot project to use the potential flexibility of heat pumps for congestion management in power grids. The ViFlex project is aimed at combining a three-digit number of heat pumps and electricity storage systems to form a virtual power plant. With this approach, the heat pumps are bundled in virtual power plants to absorb surplus electricity from renewables and relieve the power grid.', 'The project relies on Viessmann heat pumps that can be operated with 100 percent renewable electricity. “ These heat pumps can work and fill the heat storage system when a lot of solar power comes from the roof or the wind is blowing strongly in Germany and there is a lot of wind power available in the grid, ” Tennet explained.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

SMETS 2 meters already have an aux load mechanism.', 'The Dutch are famously prickly over the privacy of their data.. Tennet can find expertise on these issues easily if it cares to look. Householders don’ t want to hand over control of their homes to a remote utility, even a fairly benevolent state-owned one like Tennet. The legal framework has to be an arm’ s-length regulated contract, with remotely triggered actions executed by prior consent. What we really need is an AI Jeeves at the door of our smart home, to defend our interests against Aunt Agatha.', 'It’ s solvable without a remote utility being in control.', 'I’ ve done all the work on this already, and it just involves a change in the pricing model, and a device that could be mass produced for 50 euros.', 'This system was prototyped in the UK. There are two houses with this mechanism, one has been running for about 4 years in a bungalow the North of England, and another larger house has been running for a year in South of England. The North of England bungalow, built in around 1978, averages a total house energy input per year of 4200 units, and it’ s heat electric.', 'This mechanism is excellent, and it does work. It’ s called demand side control by government, but the guy who did this called it something else.', 'The southern based 6 bed house, can mid-winter turn into an 6 kw continuous sink for excess wind power, and can take about 30kw for a few hours, and then spontaneously return to 600 watts average when necessary.', 'During the Summer months, from March to October because of the oversizing, the whole house averages about 12 units a day, this includes heating, baths for 5 people, etc, and 5 people all working at home due to Covid.', 'It works by oversizing the solar installation, and diverting excess electricity into over heating cylinders rather than exporting it. Everything’ s stainless, copper, plastic or pex, and the cold water supply runs past all the potable sinks before it heads to the roof, runs through a pressure limiter before it branches to fill toilets. This means any toilet flush pulls fresh cold water past every sink.', 'It’ s not installed yet, but the system can run automatically on over wind production, and is just waiting on a tariff and meter that supports a relay.', 'The only moving parts are pumps, and thermostats, all off the shelf, most running at 2 watts.', 'The key is to make sure you have meters that can measure not just how much electricity you use, but when. Sure heat pumps, but 14% of Eurpean car sales were BEV with substantial batteries, so they need to charge when there is plenty of renewables production.', 'This makes no sense. There are more efficient less expensive ways to accomplish.', 'I am from Canada in the eastern part of the country. We use Air to Air Pumps extensively with a backup that can either be propane, electric or other forms. The most popular types are the Air to Air Mini heat pumps that heat a single area and have a ratio of about 2 to 1 heat gain. As the temperature dips below -10 C the backup source is needed but overall these systems provide a substantial source of heat with a pay back period of about 7 years depending on the size of the house. The Air to Air systems in reverse also serve as a cooling system in the summer.', 'In my experience I’ ve also used air to air well in the UK Angus.', 'I found through modelling that chaining reservoirs together using air 2 water, and heating them in one direction indirectly, but taking hot water from them in the opposite together to be a highly effective mechanism because it ensures the water returning to the heat pump to be quite cold until all reservoirs are hot.', 'It also allows just one or two small reservoirs to be heated with immersions, to kill legionella, this making it a good way of heating large amounts of water quite efficiently.', 'Flexible heat pumps ideal for power grids congested by solar and wind.

However, less than half – just under 2,000 MWe – has been developed. This is despite the government enacting policies in the recent years to attract additional investment in the geothermal industry. In an editorial piece published in the Manila Times, it was pointed out that the Philippines is wasting the opportunity to take advantage of its geothermal resources, as also concluded by recent assessment of the country’ s energy sector. The Philippines is currently the third-largest geothermal energy producer in the world after Indonesia and the United States. Progress in policy To the credit of the DOE, there has been significant progress is the recent years to develop policies in support of renewable energy in line with the “ Philippine Energy Plan 2016-2030. ” According to this roadmap, geothermal should account for 40% of all renewable energy in the country by 2030 and have an overall capacity of 4,000 MW by 2040. So far, supporting policies include the Renewable Portfolio Standards ( RPS), the Green Energy Option Program ( GEOP), the Enhanced Net Metering Program, and the establishment of the Renewable Energy Market. In October last year, it was also announced that large-scale ( $ 50 million or more initial investment) geothermal projects can be 100% foreign-owned. Obstacles still remain Despite enacting these policies, development and investment in the geothermal sector remain slow. There are still too many obstacles that the new policies fail to address. A recent tender of five geothermal pre-determined areas ( PDA) accounted only for a potential capacity of 87 MW – indicative of the glacial pace of any future development. Of the five PDA’ s offered for tender, only three projects ( Daklan, Puting Lupa, Mt. Labo) received bids while the other two ( Itogon, Maricaban) remained open for direct application.

As the cleanest-burning fossil fuel, natural gas and LNG have a central role to play in delivering the energy the world needs and helping power progress towards these targets. ”', 'Shell definitely has some skin in the game.', 'Earlier this month, the Anglo-Dutch supermajor announced its most ambitious makeover in its century-old history. It is throttling back oil production as it inches toward a low-carbon future, but for natural gas, the global opportunities abound. The percentage of total gas in Shell’ s portfolio “ is expected to rise to around 55% or more ” by the end of the decade, CEO Ben van Beurden told investors at the time.', 'As global gas consumption expands, Shell also may be eyeing a plethora of opportunities. The latest LNG analysis is forecasting a supply-demand gap opening around 2025, with less production coming onstream than previously projected.', 'Shell estimated that only 3 mmt in new LNG production capacity was announced in 2020, down from an expected 60 mmt, researchers noted.', 'This year, it is looking stronger. For example, Shell’ s frequent partner and No. 1 gas producer Qatar Petroleum this month said it was sanctioning its largest LNG expansion ever at the massive North Field.', 'U.S. projects also may move forward. For example, Houston-based NextDecade Corp. has said it plans to reach a final investment decision this year on “ a minimum of two trains ” at the proposed export terminal in South Texas. Wood Mackenzie also has estimated that $ 11 billion of Australian gas projects could be sanctioned this year.', 'Carbon-Neutral Gains', 'Last year, gas demand rebounded in Asia, China and India following the outbreak of the pandemic, Shell data showed. China increased its LNG imports in 2020 by an estimated 11% from 2019, or 7 mmt, to 67 mmt.', '“ China’ s announcement of a target to become carbon-neutral by 2060 is expected to continue driving up its LNG demand, ” researchers noted. LNG is forecast to play a “ key role ” in decarbonizing China’ s “ hard-to-abate sectors, namely buildings, heavy industry, shipping and heavy-duty road transport. ”', 'Meanwhile, India increased LNG imports by 11% year/year in 2020 as it took advantage of lower prices to supplement domestic gas production.', '“ Two other major Asian LNG-importing countries – Japan and South Korea – also announced net-zero emissions targets in 2020, ” researchers noted. Those targets should lead to more gas consumption. For example, to meet its net-zero target, South Korea plans to switch 24 coal-fired power plants to LNG by 2034, researchers said.', 'Meanwhile, European demand, alongside “ flexible U.S. supply, helped to balance the global LNG market in the first half of 2020, ” according to Shell.', '“ However, supply outages in other basins, structural constraints and extreme weather later in the year resulted in higher prices. ”', 'By 2040, global LNG demand is estimated to hit 700 mmt, driven by a 75% surge in Asian growth.', '“ For instance, China’ s heavy-duty transport sector consumed nearly 13 mmt of LNG in 2020, almost doubling from 2018, to serve the fast-growing fleet of well over 500,000 LNG-fueled trucks and buses, ” researchers said.', '“ LNG-fueled shipping is also growing, with the number of vessels expected to more than double, with bunkering vessels set to reach 45 by 2023. ”', 'Shell is looking to find an advantage in that sector. The producer already has chartered four newbuild, low-emission tankers that are scheduled for delivery beginning in mid-2024.', '“ According to estimates, more than half of future LNG demand will come from countries with net-zero emissions targets, ” researchers said. “ The LNG industry will need to innovate at every stage of the value chain to lower emissions and play a key role in powering hard-to-abate sectors. ”', '© 2021 Natural Gas Intelligence.

16668,How Will Future Larger Turbines Impact Wind Project Electricity Output & Surrounding Community Sound Levels?,2023-03-25,,"['Multiple technological, social, and market factors of wind power are evolving rapidly. Most notably, significant wind turbine scaling in height and size is occurring and is forecasted to continue. While the larger turbines expected to be deployed in the future are more powerful and efficient, they are also expected to operate with higher sound emissions than those installed in the last decade. Due to their taller heights, larger rotors, and higher sound power levels, future wind turbines will require larger setbacks from homes and greater inter-turbine spacing, resulting in fewer turbines deployed for a given land area. These competing technology and siting trends – and their associated impacts – are not well understood.', 'The new Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory analysis “ Effects of land-based wind turbine upsizing on community sound levels and power and energy density ” simulates the development of 22 unique projects at two different prototypical sites using eleven different wind turbine models to extract output, nameplate capacity, numbers of turbines and receptor sound level patterns between projects using older, current, and future turbine models sited within a fixed land area.', 'The study, published in Applied Energy in open-access format, is available here ( link is external). The authors will host a webinar covering the results of the study on April 13, 2023, at 1 PM Eastern / 10 AM Pacific. Register here: https: //lbnl.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN ljqJqmyWQEaSl0nC99kDdQ ( link is external).', 'The analysis finds, unsurprisingly, future turbines are more than 60% taller than those installed most frequently in the last decade. Relatedly, 60% fewer turbines are expected to be able to fit in the same land area in the future as they were in the past.', 'From the Then period ( using the most frequently installed turbines in the last decade in the US, 2011-2020) to the Future period ( turbines that are expected to be installed in the next three to five years, 2023-2025), wind turbine heights are expected to increase an average of 60%, from 122 m to 202 m ( Figure 1). This increase in turbine total height, coupled with larger rotor diameters and sound power level increases, decreases the number of turbines that can be developed in the fixed land area at our two prototypical sites. Accordingly, the average number of turbines decreases by 60% ( from 222 to 89) at those sites. ( See Figure 1 caption for more details on periods.)', 'Despite fewer turbines, plant layouts using future turbines result in projects with higher installed capacities and annual energy output for a given land area.', 'Despite 60% fewer turbines for the given land area at the two sites, the total installed nameplate capacity for Future projects increases by roughly 11% ( from 395 MW to 437 MW), and estimated annual energy output increases by almost 60% ( from 1,146 GWh/yr to 1,825 GWh/yr) over the Then period. These average trends are shared among all the manufacturers and across both sites, with some variation in the size of those trends ( not shown). These output increases are driven, in large part, by significant increases in rated capacity and efficiency of the turbine models used in the Future period.', 'Community sound levels at homes are expected to be significantly lower in the future, despite overall louder turbines.', 'Even though serrated trailing edges ( STE), which lower sound levels by approximately 1.5 dBA, are expected to be applied to the blades of all future turbine models, turbine sound levels ( at the hub) for Future turbines are higher ( 105.3 dBA) than for Then turbines ( 104.3 dBA). Despite this predicted increase, sound levels at homes surrounding the turbines are estimated to be 18% lower in the Future period. This decrease is the result of increases in setbacks from the homes which scale as a multiple of turbine height and a factor of turbine sound power, as well as fewer wind turbines being constructed in the same land area.', 'Figure 1. Mean total wind turbine height, numbers of wind turbines, total project capacity, project output, and loudness among the periods examined. Those periods were chosen to represent, respectively; Then: turbines most frequently installed in the last decade in the US ( 2011–2020); Now: turbines most frequently installed in the last two years in the US ( 2019–2020); and, Future: turbines most likely to be installed in the next three to five years in the US ( i.e., 2023-2025). All Future turbines are expected to have serrated trailing edges to reduce sound levels ( STE), so separate projects were designed using turbines representing the Now period with STE ( Now with STE) and all Future turbines contain STE to align with manufacturer expectations.', 'A commonly mentioned potential nuisance for homes very near wind projects are turbine sounds. Yet our research finds that average estimated receptor sound pressure levels ( SPL) ( a measurement of what neighboring home inhabitants might hear) surrounding the projects in all periods show consistent decreases from those estimated in the Then period ( Figure 2). This is especially pronounced for the Future period, where decreases are between 1.5 and 3 dB. Participating homes, which are located on parcels where turbines can be hosted, tend to be closer to wind turbines and are also subject to higher noise limits when designing the projects relative to non-participants’ homes. But, our research finds a reduction in SPL in all periods occurs for those homes, as well as their nonparticipating neighbors. This implies that future turbines might significantly reduce a common potential nuisance.', 'Figure 2. Average change of overall A-weighted sound pressure levels ( SPL) measured are receptor homes referenced to Then ( i.e., starting) SPL by participation. Nonparticipants, those near the projects, are shown as solid lines and participants, those with parcels where turbines can be located, are shown as dashed.', 'Figure 2. Average change of overall A-weighted sound pressure levels ( SPL) measured are receptor homes referenced to Then ( i.e., starting) SPL by participation. Nonparticipants, those near the projects, are shown as solid lines and participants, those with parcels where turbines can be located, are shown as dashed.', 'Because of their increased size, turbines installed in the future will be situated further from homes and property lines given often required setbacks based on total height. Additionally, fewer turbines used for future projects might provide enhanced flexibility as to where turbines are placed on the land, therefore, potentially, creating greater opportunity to avoid sensitive viewsheds. Further, higher project capacities and output could lead to higher local economic benefits ( e.g., taxes and income).', 'A number of areas for future research are suggested such as: examining aesthetic tradeoffs of fewer larger turbines vs. more numerous smaller turbines; the need to examine outcomes at other sites ( ridgelines and alternative wind regimes); and, the value of conducting economic analyses using turbines to be installed in the future.', 'We thank the U.S. Department of Energy’ s Wind Energy Technologies Office for their support of this work, as well as the numerous individuals and organizations who generously provided data, information and reviewed our study.', 'We publish a number of guest posts from experts in a large variety of fields.

The found that perovskite PV could be cost-competitive with other technologies even at much smaller scale, but noted that this still depends on the tech proving its long-term stability, and impressive achievements in research being successfully transferred to commercial production.', ""After quickly demonstrating potential for high-efficiency solar energy using lower cost materials and lower energy in fabrication compared to today’ s silicon PV technology, perovskites are well on their way to commercialization. Many different possibilities exist as to the form these commercial products could take, and the materials they could contain. And it's likely that more than one option could prove commercially viable."", 'Scientists led by the École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne in Switzerland designed one possible process for the production of single-junction perovskite modules. They modeled all of the associated costs for manufacturing and installation of modules produced on a 100 MW production line based on their processes.', 'They described the production line and modeling in full in “ Design and Cost Analysis of 100 MW Perovskite Solar Panel Manufacturing Process in Different Locations, ” published in ACS Energy Letters. The group compared various material and processing options and found that a tin-oxide electron transport layer coupled with silver paste electrode would yield the lowest production cost and energy consumption, of the options compared in the study.', 'The group also calculated the minimum sustainable price, levelized cost of energy, and energy payback time for various locations. On the manufacturing side, they noted significant regional differences in the cost of processing glass, while their energy cost and payback calculations were largely affected by different land, labor and energy costs between regions, as well as climate conditions for installation.', 'The model predicts that a 100 MW perovskite production would require approximately 5.6 kWh of electricity per square meter of module. Based on installation in sunny locations such as Spain or Egypt, it could achieve an LCOE between $ 0.03/kWh and $ 0.04/kWh, reaching energy payback in a little over six months.', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

More info."", 'A new study published in the journal Global Food Security reports that food systems are associated with one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions induced by human activity. As such, agricultural yields are at risk because of impacts caused by climate change.', 'However, there is still a lack of a complete picture of the various elements of the agricultural research and food production ecosystem.', 'To tackle this issue, the researchers performed a survey of 262 attendees of the 2019 Global Science Conference on Climate-Smart Agriculture ( CSA) in Bali, Indonesia, which included researchers, end-users, and funders. The aim was to evaluate the main leverage points required to radically shift the food system to a new place.', 'According to Dhanush Dinesh, a CIAT researcher and head of partnerships and outreach at CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security ( CCAFS), one of the key findings was that to realize climate and sustainability goals, it is necessary to consider farmers as partners in research. They should contribute while also being beneficiaries.', 'Dinesh adds that conventionally, farmers have always been “ policy takers ” and not “ policymakers. ”', 'Researchers can design new tools for research but to help farmers, we need to know what their financial and policy needs are. All this is a shift in power from researchers as the powerful knowledge providers to a place where funders, farmers and researchers everyone is equal and shaping it in an equitable way... It’ s not happening now, but we are recognising this needs to change.', 'According to Bruce Campbell, a CIAT researcher and director of CCAFS, a considerable part of the research effort must shift to an action mode—participatory action research or “ learning by doing. ”', 'By working closely with farmers to trial things they are interested in testing, researchers can present a basket of possibilities for testing and farmers can select what they want to test and also bring their own knowledge to what should be tested.', 'Campbell added that experience shows that the study can then take unexpected directions.', '“ For example, research may have planned to look at the dominant maize crop, but on speaking with the farmer, the research shifted to examining intercropping, with more effort focussed on the intercrop than the maize crop, ” he noted.', 'Dinesh explained that another crucial aspect for the success of future food systems was innovative funding models. He added that RaboBank, a leading international bank, had already come up with a new fund called AGRI3. The Netherlands government has invested, thereby minimizing the risk to the bank.', '“ They can then loan to the farmers to implement climate-smart agriculture, but to deliver at scale, they need to develop monitoring systems, ” he added.', 'As explained by Laurens Klerkx, a co-author on the study and Professor of Agrifood Innovation and Transition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, certain examples of innovative funding models that enhance outcomes for researchers and farmers are models that include joint agenda setting where farmers can decide on priority setting, proposal focus, and decision making, as well as induce ownership.', '“ These include levy-funded R & D systems, farmer jury’ s, etc., ” added Klerkx, noting that though these are not completely innovative, they may be a part of the agricultural for development ( AR4D) context.', 'Campbell adds that combined finance models can promote high-impact transformative projects in areas that are at first unable to obtain commercial finance but have the prospects to become commercially viable as time passes.', 'There is a nice example in Rwanda with Africa Improved Foods: They put up a food processing plan for the production of nutritious foods ( e.g. cereals) with the raw material sourced from smallholders and the first phase of the project costs approximately $ 65 million in capital expenditure and working capital.', '“ This would not have taken off without a blended finance model, with a mixture of funding sources, some concessional...

On its first day at the front of the Nymex futures curve, the February contract settled at $ 4.559/MMBtu, off 12.6 cents from Wednesday’ s close. March futures slipped 7.7 cents to $ 4.117.', 'Spot gas, which traded Thursday for gas delivery through Saturday, continued to move lower amid modest heating demand. NGI’ s Spot Gas National Avg. tumbled $ 1.355 to $ 4.715.', 'With folks in Texas ditching the Uggs for shorts and t-shirts, unseasonably strong high pressure was set to expand across the southern and eastern United States the next several days as frigid cold retreated into Canada. Daytime temperatures in the 60s to lower 80s were forecast for the southern states going forward, with highs in the 40s to 60s over the Great Lakes and East. NatGasWeather said this should result in the warmest weather on record for this time of year.', 'The West Coast, meanwhile, should see near-normal temperatures next week as Pacific weather systems bring rain, snow and chilly conditions to the region. However, this is not nearly cold enough to counter warm conditions elsewhere, according to NatGasWeather.', 'There were some mixed trends in the latest weather data as the American model shifted slightly colder for the coming two weeks, while the European model shifted warmer. Even with the colder run in the Global Forecast System, however, the period through Jan. 9 remained warmer than normal.', '“ The official start of winter is only one week in and with still plenty of time for cold temperatures to draw on U.S. supplies, ” NatGasWeather said. “ However, a near-record warm pattern to end December and through the first half of January has led to massive risk-off trade and inflicted considerable damage to winter strip prices. ”', 'Whether continued weakness in futures prices is warranted is up for debate, but it is noteworthy that the latest government inventory data – which took several analysts by surprise – failed to stop the bleeding in the gas market.', 'The U.S. Energy Information Administration ( EIA) on Thursday reported a stunning 213 Bcf withdrawal from storage for the week ending Dec. 23. The triple-digit draw was near the high end of most major surveys, and analysts had indicated prior to the report that predicting the withdrawal would be difficult given that schools were closed, people were home, and yet some businesses were staying open later than usual.', 'The wide range of estimates ahead of the EIA report reflected the uncertainty in how the winter storm would impact the supply/demand balance. A Reuters survey of 11 analysts produced a range of withdrawal estimates from 169 Bcf to 218 Bcf, with a median decrease of 199 Bcf. Bloomberg had a slightly tighter range but also had a median draw of 199 Bcf, while a Wall Street Journal poll averaged a 201 Bcf pull. NGI modeled a 199 Bcf withdrawal.', 'For comparison, 125 Bcf was pulled out of storage in the year-earlier period, while the five-year average draw is 106 Bcf.', 'The latest EIA figure is a “ tough number to extrapolate from…not bearish, in my opinion, ” said one participant on Enelyst, an online energy chat. “ Not sure it means much. ”', 'Other Enelyst participants agreed the 213 Bcf withdrawal indicated the market was tighter than expected. However, they noted that the pull from South Central salt stocks fell short of projections. With frigid weather descending into Texas late in the reference period, they said stronger draws should be reflected in next week’ s EIA report.', 'Broken down by region, the Midwest led with a monstrous 75 Bcf withdrawal from inventories, according to EIA. The South Central followed with a net 63 Bcf pull that included a 45 Bcf draw from nonsalt facilities and a 17 Bcf pull from salts. East stocks fell by 42 Bcf, while Pacific stocks slid by 21 Bcf. Mountain inventories dropped by 12 Bcf.', 'Total working gas in storage fell to 3,112 Bcf, which is 133 Bcf below year-earlier levels and 85 Bcf below the five-year average, according to EIA.', 'Despite the bullish EIA data, forecasts for record warmth in the first half of January proved too much to overcome. “ With the early predictions of a warmish January, will need some good cold in February to pull down inventories, ” said an Enelyst participant.', 'Celsius Energy By Force Majeure analysts agreed.', '“ This was an unequivocally bullish draw, but investors remain focused on the early January warmth. ”', 'With weekend demand coming into the mix during Thursday trading, spot gas prices continued to post dramatic losses. Though West Coast locations remained sharply higher given ongoing cold in that region, along with a slew of other issues, the vast majority of U.S. prices sported $ 3.00 handles for the two-day gas delivery.', 'Benchmark Henry Hub tumbled 42.0 cents day/day to average $ 3.695, while Transco Zone 5 plunged $ 2.005 to $ 3.645.', 'Some Appalachia locations slid even lower. Eastern Gas South averaged $ 2.980 after falling 65.0 cents on the day, while Tennessee Zn 4 Marcellus hit $ 2.925 after tumbling 77.0 cents.', 'Meanwhile, more than a dozen natural gas pipelines on Thursday lifted restrictions imposed during Elliott.', 'However, Gulf Coast Express ( GCX) alerted customers on Wednesday that maintenance is required on the Devil’ s Run Compressor Station because of unforeseen circumstances.

Known as Integrated+, the release to all eligible homes in the National Electricity Market ( NEM) follows a trial in Victoria.', 'Integrated+ is made possible by the Federal Government’ s Consumer Data Right ( CDR) program, which aims to standardize secure data sharing for the benefit of consumers. It “ allows you to ask for your data to be securely transferred to an accredited provider so you can investigate, compare and access services more easily. ”', 'Initially implemented in the banking sector, this program has now been expanded to encompass the energy sector, with the big three retailers with 65% market share taking part, and more retailers to come, following rules that any retailer with more than 10,000 customers will be required to comply with the CDR.', 'There are limitations to the potential savings, though they are substantial. This is partially offset by the need to pay a monthly subscription of around $ 10 per month to Solar Analytics for Integrated+, though there are additional features beyond the service. Additionally, the standard method for data uploads on retail metering involves a once-daily data upload, which may not be ideal for solar owners seeking real-time data, meaning consumption data will always be historical and a day behind. Still, the company said the majority of solar owners who participated in the trail found it sufficient.', '“ Having been in the solar industry for 30 years, it has always bothered me that valuable data captured by retail meters was not easily accessible to solar owners, ” Nigel Morris, head of business development at Solar Analytics, told pv magazine. “ It has taken far too long, but retailers are now legally obligated to share this data. It is a game-changer for solar owners and, in my opinion, represents the future of data access. ”', 'This content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

Even though the volume of flexible packaging is smaller by weight and space, most flexible packaging can not be practically recycled. Flexible packaging isn’ t made of pure plastic polymers but rather made by blending several materials.

80490,How the Inflation Reduction Act will help more nonprofits go solar,2022-12-21,,"['The Inflation Reduction Act ( IRA) signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022, dedicates $ 369 billion to combat climate change. This landmark legislation aims to build a clean energy economy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by approximately 40% by 2030, according to the federal government. One of the most significant provisions of the law financially incentivizes nonprofit organizations to go solar. The IRA allows nonprofits to access the solar investment tax credit ( ITC) through a direct pay option.', 'As nonprofit organizations take advantage of IRA incentives to move to solar energy, mission-driven community-based lenders focused on accelerating the transition to a clean energy future will help these organizations secure low-cost capital to finance these projects.', 'The U.S. Department of the Treasury noted that the “ Inflation Reduction Act recognizes that state, local and Tribal governments, as well as nonprofit organizations and other tax-exempt entities, have played and will continue to play a central role in making investments to build a clean energy economy. To further promote broad-based investment across the country, the Inflation Reduction Act allows these actors to receive certain tax credits as direct payments from the Internal Revenue Service, streamlining these entities’ access to key incentives and supporting their investments in local communities. ”', 'This means schools, hospitals, charities, faith-based organizations, rural electric cooperatives and other tax-exempt entities are now eligible to receive a lump-sum payment — in lieu of a tax credit from the federal government — of at least 30% for eligible energy projects such as installing a solar PV system. That’ s good news for nonprofit organizations aiming to lower electricity costs and reduce carbon footprints.', 'Making clean energy more accessible to nonprofits is also good news for the solar industry. Research firm Rystad Energy projects that the IRA will boost installed solar capacity which will deliver an estimated $ 110 billion of capital expenditure.', 'Analyst firm Wood Mackenzie noted that the IRA will bring some much-needed long-term certainty to the renewables sector with total investment in renewables reaching $ 1.2 trillion through 2035. According to the firm, solar will be a major beneficiary. Solar incentives in the legislation are projected to result in a “ 67% increase in solar additions between 2022 and 2032 compared to what would have happened without the IRA incentives. ”', 'Prior to the IRA, nonprofit organizations lacked the tax liability to take advantage of ITCs for installing solar systems. With the IRA making solar tax credits more accessible, nonprofit organizations can more easily finance and purchase their own solar systems. Banks focused on environmental sustainability are ready to help fund these projects.', 'In fact, renewable energy is becoming a key priority for many lenders. To support the UN’ s Sustainable Development Goals of affordable and clean energy, sustainable cities and communities, climate action and partnerships, many banks are developing specialized commercial loan products designed to encourage the use of solar energy. These loan products include loans for rooftop solar systems, loans for energy efficiency improvements, sustainably certified commercial real estate financing, and sustainably certified construction loans.', 'Banks focused on accelerating the transition to clean energy are best positioned to help nonprofits secure advantageous funding for their solar installations. Specialist lenders like Climate First Bank and others have the institutional knowledge and technical know-how to develop innovative funding structures with favorable rates and terms designed to help nonprofits finance these installations.', 'There is no doubt that the IRA coupled with financing tools that provide funding support for clean energy projects will catalyze nonprofit organizations to deploy solar energy and speed their transition to a net-zero emissions future. Going solar will offer these organizations long-term cost savings while providing the benefits of combatting climate change, creating jobs and bringing new investment into their communities.', 'Summing up the bottom-line benefits of the IRA, a blog post by Candace Vahlsing, associate director for climate, energy, environment, and science with the White Houses’ s Office of Management and Budget, said “ the Inflation Reduction Act will help ease the burden that climate change imposes on the American public, strengthen our economy, and reduce future financial risks to the Federal Government and to taxpayers. ”', 'Ken LaRoe is a leader in the field of ethical banking and believes that finance industry is responsible for driving positive change for the planet and its peoples. Three years after the sale of his first bank, Florida Choice Bank, LaRoe was able to put this approach into action with the founding of First GREEN Bank in 2009. Under LaRoe’ s leadership, First GREEN Bank expanded across Florida and his values-based business model demonstrated that financial excellence can occur without ethical compromise. He then created Climate First Bank in 2021, an FDIC-approved commercial bank with a mission to drawdown atmospheric CO2 by accelerating the clean energy transition.', 'Thank you for this article. I am interested in financing for Non-Profits and Business/Commercial projects. The problem is they normally want the project to be very large or they want to do a PPA so they can take the tax benefit as well as the depreciation. Recently here in San Diego Ygrene is not taking new applications. They are essentially discontinuing business. I am looking for finance alternatives. Also is the direct pay available to Non-Profits who have gone solar and have not used the tax credit ( because the could not) nor have they assigned this tax credit to anyone. In other words is it retroactive. Who is charing the directive committee in congress? I am a solar installer', 'William, I don’ t believe the direct pay is retroactive – generally it is for projects that are deployed 1/1/2023 or later.', 'William, I am a solar broker and attempting to find ways to help non-profit organizations convert to solar with out cost ( PPA). If you find sources that help with this please send me that info. I am in South East USA where solar has been slow to prosper. Ward Riggins http: //www.essentialaltenergy.com', 'Treasury direction will potentially unlock a flood of funding – We, at Lattice Energy Solutions, are prepared to address the demand at scale.', 'Any idea of when the Treasury will issue guidance on how to apply for the funds for non profits/govt. agencies for solar projects?', 'I would like to know the timeline on this as well.', 'The IRA is a great step forward, I’ m a trustee on a rural electric co-op board and so far have been unable to even get the board to consider buying out 50% of our G & T contract so that we can self generate at economies of scale with battery storage backup.
